I’m happy I have stuck with this.</p>
<p>I’m tired and slept way too little last night. I’m grappling with anxieties over traveling. I hate that I’m so resistant to change and new things. I could just hop on a plane today and go on adventures, but I don’t. Instead I’d rather stick around in an environment that is toxic.</p>
<p>I want to go live life than anything but the moment I start thinking about it I get deep anxieties in the pit of my stomach and I cant think or sleep. I feel like I’m never going to overcome it. I feel like it will never go away.</p>
<p>I feel broken and unable to be the person I want to be. The worst feeling in the world is to not be able to be who you want to be.</p>
<p>There has to be some solution, some way I can make progress toward who I want to be. There has to be some way to overcome my nature, my neurology. It cant be my destiny to end up an 80 year old hermit that does the same thing every day and has done the same thing every day all his life. I CANT STAND THE THOUGHT OF MY LIFE BEING THAT</p>
<p>I cant let myself become that story. I cant let myself continue to be that. Somehow I continue to be that.</p>
<p>I have overcome so many aspects of neurology, the lack of social capabilities, my tendency to focus too much, my learning difficulties. I have rewired and remade parts of myself through sheer force of effort. But when it comes to neurology that intersect with my anxieties I cant seem to do shit to overcome them. I’m disabled by them.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get over them, enough to do some tiny thing, but it takes me so much effort. It cant continue to take me years just to work up the nerve to fly on my own. I have to get way better but I feel no better than I was 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I haven’t landed on a way to make progress yet, but I am determined to. I need to become someone not defined by my anxieties. I need to become me.</p>

They weren’t supposed to be red damnit they were supposed to be blue and orange not red. I had asked my mom about the colors of the cubbies before going and she had told me they’d be blue and orange.</p>
<p>My mom thought I had social anxiety and was scared of kindergarten. Really I was freaked out about the colors of cubbies. SHE HAD LIED TO ME</p>
<p>Several years ago I was in New York with family and they wanted to stop for something to eat. They wanted to stop at a random place to eat. I hated the idea, because I had never been to that restaurant before. What if was noisy? What sort of wallpaper did the place have? What temp was the AC set at? I protested and protested until they gave up on the idea. My excuses were full of lies, I claimed to not be hungry (I was starving), I claimed to be ready to return home, I claimed that the place would be too costly and we should just go to Mcdonalds (some place I was familiar with)</p>
<p>That night I cried. It was silly, but I felt like a shitty person for ruining everyone’s experience. I was 18, I should have been capable of handling a new restaurant but the idea of it sent me into a huge panic wave of anxiety.</p>
<p>My life has been defined by my inability to overcome to my anxieties. I worry constantly. I worry about the future, I worry about messing up, I worry about a thousand things going wrong.</p>
<p>My worry becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I worry about things, which leads to stress, which leads to me messing up my life.</p>
<p>I’d give anything to just be able to exist. To live in the moment, to just be me. But my brain worries on a constant basis. My brain is terrified by every new experience and every little change.</p>
<p>I’m a human forever dreaming of having adventures but trapped by inability to desire or even cope with the simplest of changes. I love a lot of my autistic traits; my ability to focus, my insane drive, my special interests, my obsession with details; but the one trait at the top of the list I could do without; my constant desire for routine.</p>
<p>A part of me hates travel. The new experiences they are all terrible to a part of my brain. It takes plunging in to for me to go.</p>
<p>I waited until the last minute to decide to go to Valiocon because a part of me was terrified of going. Not over the normal things that make people anxious. Not over the social aspects, the meeting people, or getting an uber to the hotel. These are normal stressors for people with anxiety issues. Not me, I worried about the layout of the hotel and whether the badges would have a decent font. If the layout of the hotel had been &quot;wrong&quot;, I wouldn’t have slept the first night.</p>
<p>This sounds a lot like OCD, it is definitely similar in nature, but different. I lack the compulsive element that defines OCD people. Once a change happens I’m quiet accepting of it, often immediately. I have no neuorological tick that forces me to do something in a specific way, I just prefer doing it the same way. I can adjust but i comes with resistence. It took me a day to adjust to the red cubbies. It took me about a day to adjust to problems in the design of the hotel.</p>
<p>Some people have advised me before that I should be more accepting of my traits. They say that there is nothing wrong with being routine oriented. Plenty of people live their lives in the same routines, for forever.</p>
<p>I don’t want to die an 80 year old that has lived in same apartment for 40 year, goes to the same place to eat and eats the same thing 3 meals a day, has never married, never traveled. I don’t want to become that person. That isn’t who I feel I am meant to be, but it seems like it is a destiny constantly creeping up on me with every passing year.</p>
<p>I hate the prospect of a life lived in routine more than anything else. People think they are comforting me when they say how I lived my life is fine, but they aren’t. I fucking hate the part of myself that has lead me to stay at home for 25 years. I don’t accept it as okay. It is not okay. I have ruined and wasted a good decade of my life letting routine kill me. I must become more. I will not become defined by my neurology. I will move beyond it, I will evolve beyond, I will become more.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get over my anxiety today and make a passport appointment. I couldn’t get over how much I hated the idea of travel. I don’t want to go someplace new, but I desperately want to be a person that explores places and goes on new adventures. I avoided making the appointment because if I have the passport in hand then I will feel the obligation to go. Right now anytime part of me gets the urge to go on an adventure I can say &quot;but I don’t have my passport&quot;, and I don’t have to fight the &quot;routine monster&quot;.</p>
<p>I want so bad to have adventures, to live a fuller life, but I also want to stay in my zone of comfort so bad. I have all this anxiety that if I had the passport I wouldn’t use it and would disappoint myself.</p>
<p>I spent most of today spiraling into this self-hating anxiety filled cycle. I spent a few hours just curled into a ball on my bed hoping for everything to go away. I got so little done. Nothing done for the most part.</p>
<p>All because I was worried about getting a damn passport. Just get the damn passport K. Get the damn passport.</p>
<p>I’m terrified so much of new experiences, so much I wont even let myself get the opportunity to have adventures.</p>
<p>Also I was worried about the layout of the passport acceptance facility. What if it has weird angles. Weird angles are the worst.</p>

I went to bed way too late last night. I shall nap later today I think.</p>
<p>I have lots of appointments I should make today but since phonecalls are stressful I have decided to stick to one. When I have like four to make it always produces anxiety for me, sometimes severe anxiety. Phonecalls don’t make me anxious just the things they are about cause me anxiety. I only ever make phone calls to make appointments; with the sole exception of a friend that cant stand eye contact so we use phonecalls instead of Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>It is funny I hate the dentist as much as most people do, but not for the typical reasons. I hate the small talk. It actually feels me with anxious feelings of dread in my stomach. Small talk is hard already, throw novocaine and drilling into a tooth into the mix and it is terrifyingly hard. I wish I could find a dentist that would just do the work and not want to talk about it. Funny thing is, I think a lot of dentists get especially talkative with me because they see I’m nervous and anxious; they are trying to get me to relax by talking. If only they knew the smalltalk is what makes me nervous. hashtag autistic problems.</p>
<p>I have found that my small talk anxiety is decreasing. Meeting strangers and Valiocon and conversing really really helped. I think I can practice the anxiety away. Eventually the exposure to small talk situations will rewire my brain. I can do it!</p>
<p>I’m fighting with npm this morning, something crazy weird is going on with nyc dependencies on a project. I keep getting the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">&gt; nyc ava | tap-spec

module.js:341
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module 'lru-cache'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:339:15)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:290:25)

</code></pre>
<p>I think what is happening is that something didn’t specify lru-cache. Maybe someone expected to be a dependency of something else, and it was removed as a dependency, breaking things all the way up the stack. I don’t know. Small npm issues like this occur constantly though. It amazes me how broken npm is for something so widely used. Powers half the web and it is frustratingly bad. We need better tools.</p>
<p>I need a nap.</p>
<h2>Things I Will Do Today</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get a PR finished and merged for work project</li>
<li>Laundry</li>
<li>Make passport appointment</li>
<li>Groom Nana (my Newfoundland dog)</li>
<li>Finish GetGoodAt backend. Ambitious. But I’m going to code like crazy this evening. I can do it!</li>

It could have been better but no complaints. I got all the things I needed to get done done and by the end of the day I felt stress free. Feeling stress free is the bestest feeling in the world.</p>
<p>I’m still massively excited about GetGoodAt. I’m getting in a couple hours hacking on its codebase here and there. Eventually it will come together. Then Sqircle will come together. I’m determined to start launching some more projects.</p>
<p>I have realized how crucial little things like social and work life balance are for work. I was killing myself hours wise for work before I left for Valiocon. Bizarrely I have cut down my hours and found myself way more productive. Hours are the least important thing for success. Work smarter not more.</p>
<p>I have heard and read that advice a million times but have started to see the results myself and it is starting to click. Maybe I will figure out this life thing yet.</p>
<p>This daily writing has been a very good force break. Once I have GetGoodAt out I’m going to start some daily coding and daily UI stuff. I need to force myself to self-care and take breaks for side-projects. It sounds counterintuitive but the less I work the more work I get done. I need to force more time for side projects and making into my life, then work will follow suit.</p>
<p>I spent so many years killing myself hours wise because I have had this false idea that if I wasn’t obsessively moving towards some goal I was less productive. My obsession over productively living just made me less productive. The lessons are finally sticking I think, I’m finally getting a handle on my life.</p>
<p>It feels kind of silly but these journal entries make me feel accomplished. They are little things that few people (literally I think there about 3 of you reading them all) are following but every time I finish an entry I feel good about myself. Little wins are so important I’m realizing. I need to unleash the same thing in all my projects and all my approaches.</p>
<p>I like this concept of striving for clarity in coding. I forget where I first read it, it might have something Avdi Grimm wrote or maybe it was Rich Hickey, who knows; it is one of those ideas multiple thinkers tend to hit on. The basic concept is that we shouldn’t strive for greater abstractions in code, we should strive for greater clarity. Sometimes less lines are not better, if more lines will increase the clarity of your code. Abstractions shouldn’t be the goal they should be the result of seeking greater clarity.</p>
<p>The reason we end up with such proliferation of frameworks is because no one understands how to do the thing. And figure out how to do the thing, they write a framework.</p>
<p>The frameworks that truly stick are those that give you <em>clarity</em>, showing you how to do the thing while simultaneously doing the thing for you. If you understand how your tool works you will use it.</p>
<p>A good recent example is Redux. There were lots of Flux libraries for Redux but few really stuck. They lacked clarity. Everyone that seriously wanted to learn Flux would dive in and build their own implementation. Before long, you had dozens of options.</p>
<p>Then Redux came along and strove for clarity. Many other libraries took less lines to configure and came with far more bells and whistles, but Redux destroyed them all. For one simple reason, it was easier to grok.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how short your library is in lines, how powerful the abstractions, how clever the mental model is. If it isn’t clear how to use it, if people cant see how it fits into what they do they wont &quot;get it&quot;.</p>
<p>Too many coders push further and further and strive more and more for better abstractions, clever solutions, fewer lines. We feel these are natural indicators of quality, they aren’t, they are by products of clarity. Strive for clarity and the rest will follow.</p>
<p>I think it was Richard Feynman that was once asked why his physics lectures were so &quot;simple&quot;. He replied &quot;because no one understands physics&quot;.</p>
<p>One of my favorite books is The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin. One of the main concepts of the book is that you should master simple things. Josh through some annoyingly flowery language points out that the biggest problem anyone has learning anything is that we vastly underestimate the importance of the basics. We look at someone good at something and we think he must have some esoteric, top secret knowledge or great talent. Truth is, everyone good at anything ever, is just way way better at the things you thought it wasn’t worth your time practicing.</p>
<p>As a kid I was often asked by chess parents how their kids could get good like me ( I was a strong junior player). I’d always recommend things and they would respond &quot;oh my son has read that book!&quot;. I’d tell them to read it again. But they were always convinced that I somehow had read more books, or the right books. There was no secret to my skill. I just actually learned the material. I practiced simple things endlessly until they became just part of me and it was muscle memory.</p>
<p>Humans have a strong tendency to avoid clarity in everything. We clever up all our projects and then pat ourselves on the back for building something amazing. We should have strived to focus on the little things, and made them super clear.</p>
<p>Don’t be clever.</p>
<p>Why is Apple so great? (maybe I should say was) An absolutely fanatical obsession with the details. They strive for clarity. They make products that just work. They might have less features than competitors, but what they do have users understand, they just work.</p>
<p>Like most humans I have struggled at times with procrastination. It was only when I realized that procrastination was my brain unable to understand a problem that I learned to combat. Procrastination at it’s core is often a problem of &quot;where do I start?&quot;. We have no idea so we do nothing and wait for it to come to us.</p>
<p>I learned to break tasks into smaller and smaller chunks until what to do became so clear to my brain what I needed to do. Then the procrastination just went away.</p>
<p>Make things clear.</p>
<p>I need to go to bed.</p>

I wish sleep me would stop chewing on blankets. Maybe I keep getting sexually assaulted by a hairy supernatural creature or the aliens have thick carpeting on their spaceships. I should set up cameras and go all Paranormal Activity on this mystery.</p>
<p>I’m currently obsessively excited about JavaScript parsers. The ecosystem in the JS world has finally reached a tipping point where we can easily manipulate the language. ES6 feels almost like using Clojure these days only with a much larger ecosystem.</p>
<p>In general JS has finally adopted some of the best awesomest ideas of the LISP world. For GetGoodGat I’m using a tiny functions data first approach to composing code and it is super powerful. When you couple it with a document store you get super powers that feel a lot like working with Datascript and Clojure data structures.</p>
<p>You have your original set of data and all the code just changes and transforms this data until eventually outputting it. ES6 is finally capable enough of letting me code apps as state transformations. This let’s me think of apps in turns of inputs and outputs, which is extremely powerful once you grok it.</p>
<p>On GetGoodAt I need flexible purchase model, users need to be able purchase a variety of content; courses, articles, books etc. Instead of implementing code for each of this individually I just have a function that takes any object and purchases it. All the function needs is for the object to have a price field and pretty much that it is it. So any purchasing functionality is easy, and can be added to any content type with almost no extra labor.</p>
<p>I have started to do away with ORMs on most of my projects. I think they defeat the purpose of schemaless stores and remove all the flexibility and power you get from them. Instead I validate data elsewhere. Anytime I need to stick some metadata on a document or transform it in someway I can easily do it.</p>
<p>I split up all my code into tiny functions and let functions read the details they need from state in the objects. One explicit place for state vastly simplifies code. It makes little tiny functions possible. The clojure way.</p>
<p>Today I intend to be mostly work productive. But hope this evening to get around to GetGoodAt stuff.</p>

Adequately productive and super relaxing. I’m drinking alcohol right now, a mike’s hard lemonade. I have never drank much at all (like literally once or twice a year) but had a craving for alcohol this weekend. I think Valiocon social drinking stuck a bit.</p>
<p>I got most of what I wanted to get done today done. Didn’t make as much progress on GetGoodAt as I would have hoped, but the shape of it is clear to me now. Now I just need the hours to code it.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about dev tools and how they are terrible. There are two huge problems with the current ecosystem;</p>
<ol>
<li>Tools require massive amounts of boilerplate and knowledge to get up and running</li>
<li>Dev tools are completely disconnected from the design process</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these is reflected in the JS ecosystem more than any other. We have 1000s of boilerplates, the it library changes every day and the best practices move faster than you can git clone.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t take boilerplate to get up and running. A boilerplate is a silly solution to a fundamentally broken system. We should have all we need to just get going, we shouldn’t have to use a boilerplate.</p>
<p>Solutions up to now have focused on throwing abstractions at problem. We get more libraries, more boilerplates, more blog posts. All these end up doing is adding more to the fray, confusing more than helping.</p>
<p>I think there is room for an alternative solution. One that figures out best practices for you, one that writes code for you. An AI pair programmer that eliminates all the hard parts. Hactar will be this. I’m determined to make it so.</p>
<p>The other huge issue with our tools is their disconnect from the design process. It annoys me to no end that I cant simply prototype the design and immediately have some code to work with. Then jump into code, then jump back to design mode.</p>
<p>The tools we use to design should work on the same code. We should be able to use design tools that make edits and changes to css, markup and animations.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about conversion, I’m talking about the same data. Like vector editors work well svgs we should have design tools that work well with React.</p>
<p>I had hoped Maccaw would churn out tools that did this, but they never did. I think Webflow is firmly focused on CMS. InVision is focused on prototyping and Sketch tools.</p>
<p>We need tools. I cant wait to build them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to this week. Stuff is coming together work wise and side project wise. Going to be an awesome week!</p>

I am sleepy and would rather have headed to bed. But I don’t want to break my streak, so I am going to write one.</p>
<p>I think I am getting sick. My mom and sister both have some sort of cold thing. It made my mom rather ill so I’m slightly worried it will kick my butt and interfere with productivity. Hoping for the best though.</p>
<p>I had a pretty productive day but relaxed day. Took some personal time to just relax. I feel accomplished. The only thing I didn’t get to today was running on the treadmill and fixing SSL issues on ThinkingInReact. I walked for a good 2 hours though taking photos so I think that just about counts for the treadmill stuff.</p>
<p>I’m very excited about GetGoodAt. I’m finally going to have a place to put all my tutorials and books in one spot. If all goes well it will also be a great source of extra income. I just need to finish it and get it launched.</p>

Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>Today started out pretty good, I woke up determined to be stupendously productive. I got the AC uninstalled from window, returned to warmth and then I set out to be insanely productive. Then I couldn’t track down the trap for the stray cats. Then I started to panic over a lack of work getting done. Then that made me worry about finances. Then I was hungry so I went to the grocery store and nearly got sideswiped. Then I finally got some work done and it was 3pm and I realized shit I made none of the appointments for next week. I had just enough time for some of them before closing, but here is the thing appointments take me a lot of prep time, I rehearse what I’m going to say for sometimes as much as an hour or two. Not being able to go through that routine made me worry I wouldn’t get the calls done and that sent me into a panic.</p>
<p>After some spiraling into more and more stress for a bit, I took a walk. Excercise is the best stress cure. I eventually realized that all my problems didn’t matter. So what I didn’t get what I planned to get done today. The worst that could happen wouldn’t be so bad. The stray cats might get fixed a few days later. The work might take a couple days longer. The launch of my side projects might take a few more days. Would all that be such a big deal? Nope, everything would be fine I realized.</p>
<p>Then I was fine.</p>
<p>I got literally nothing done I set out to do today. I made some progress though, which is better than nothing I suppose.</p>
<p>Today was meh but tomorrow is a new day. Tomorrow will be awesome!</p>

<p>My journaling has turned into thoughts about the weather already…</p>
<p>The JavaScript ecosystem is still driving me insane. I really need to put some effort into making more <a href="https://github.com/Hactar-js/hactar">hactar</a> plugins. It would help alleviate some of my frustrations I think.</p>
<p>I’m already feeling the lack of social being back in Idaho. I need to move to a place with a tech scene like tomorrow. Maybe I should go to a local meetup or something. But I have enough money in my bank account to Airbnb someplace for a few weeks, so maybe I should head to Seattle or Portland for a bit. I can never decide. I should just do the nomad thing and start traveling I think, I’d be happy as a digital nomad. Digital nomad it is then.</p>

Abuse is so hard to recognize from the inside. It has a way of feeling normal. When something feels normal it doesn’t feel like abuse.</p>
<p>The first time someone ever used the label “abuse” to describe my life I became very defensive. That was silly, I knew all sorts of humans that had it a thousand times worse. When I was twelve a friend of my step-dad, the father of a kid on my soccer team, murdered his wife, attempted to murder his kids and then shot him self. That was abuse. To me what I had didn’t seem all that bad. It didn’t seem remotely like abuse.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous dude. My step-dad has only hit me twice. I counted. I’m 100% certain there were only two incidents. And he only has raged three times. I counted. My biological father raged like a zillion times. 3 vs a zillion. See, the math checks out my step-dad isn’t abusive”</p>
<p>He gave me blank stares and let the conversation go.</p>
<p>When you keep track of how many times you have been hit, you are probably being abused.</p>
<p>It has taken me years to recognize the abuse I suffered as abuse. It took me a long time to recognize the trauma my biological father inflicted and even longer to recognize the trauma from my step-dad, and much much longer to recognize the damage my mom did.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about “shame” too. I remember the first time I learned that I should feel shame. I was about eight.</p>
<p>&quot;Kenny, what do your parents like to do?&quot;, she asked.<br>
“My mom really likes meth. She doesn’t get to do it anymore because they’d take me away though. My dad likes minesweeper.”<br>
At that moment I felt deeply uncomfortable and corrected myself.<br>
&quot;step-dad&quot;, I said.<br>
I breathed a sigh of relief. that could have been awkward, I thought.</p>
<p>I don’t remember much about that evening just that there was a lot of my mom getting upset with me and that I ended up grounded. I didn’t understand. I thought I was being punished for lying and I kept berating my mom with a zillion questions. I thought maybe I had got the facts wrong. Maybe she sitll does meth, I wondered. “Do you still do meth?” I asked. I wondered if maybe I lacked understanding of meth, and like it wasn’t well known and I was in trouble for not having explained things properly so that people would know what meth is. “What is meth?” I asked. This was my first conscious realization of the deep shame my mom carried around and still does.</p>
<p>I have carried around some shame myself, some for longer than others. See, for the longest time I hated the term &quot;autistic&quot;, it filled me with revulsion.  I have had some idea I might be on the spectrum for a long time, but I really didn’t like it. It took me awhile to start to see the term as positive and not a huge negative.</p>
<p>She had all the traits of a manic pixie dream girl. She was quirky, she used random catch phrases, she’d talk on and on about irrelevant things, and when maintenance workers ran a leaf-blower she’d cover her ears and scream. She was perfect.</p>
<p>When I was eleven my family took a road-trip. We camped most of the way at RV parks. It was at a KOA (an RV park chain. yes even RV parks have franchises. AMURICA = LAND OF FRENCH FRIES and FRANCHISES) that I met her. She was playing by herself in a playground full of kids engaging in a game of freeze-tag. When other kids asked her to play she would shout “no!” at inappropriate volumes.</p>
<p>She seemed confused and irritated by every social interaction. She protected her corner of the playground like it was a fragile alien planet and any intrusion of humans would destroy its ecosystem forever. She flapped her arms in excitement and talked about random things to herself. She said unintelligible things at inappropriate volumes. She was perfect.</p>
<p>To most she was a weird and bratty kid but to me she was a goddess. She had the same impulses I had but didn’t care at all about the social consequences of acting on them. She was herself and it was amazing! I didn’t just admire her I wanted to be like her. I wanted to know how she became so brave. How was she so free of anxiety?</p>
<p>For awhile at least, she integrated fine into the little playground at the KOA. She kept to her corner and the other kids kept to theirs. Every one ignored the weird girl that thought the playground was alive. It was when the kids insisted on playing near her that our fragile social structure was fractured. She shoved a kid and then proceeded to scream at him at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>Screaming girl, embarrassed dad escorting screaming girl, kids making fun of the crazy girl that hates freeze0tag. “Maybe she just really hates tag”, said one boy. “I think she is retarded or something”, said another.</p>
<p>The next day she was still at camp so I worked up my bravery to say hello. “Hello!” I said, while doing my best Jack Black impression – high kick, strange hand motions, and overzealous volume levels. At the time I was going through my mimic comedians phase. She stared blankly at me. “I’m Kenny!”, I said — well, shouted really. Still blank stares.</p>
<p>She must find me uninteresting. I should say something smart and interesting “Have you ever read A Brief History in Time? Do you like blackholes?”. She started to make some unintelligible squawks; a little weird, but every soulmate has their quirks. More strange sounds and bizarre mannerisms.</p>
<p>I started to realize that this girl wasn’t all there. Suddenly all her behaviors stopped being relatable quirks and became signs I had missed. Random freeze-tag playing kid was right – this girl is retarded! I felt so stupid for crushing on a retarded girl.</p>
<p>By now I had attracted the attention of “concerned father”, he was watching from an open RV door — half protective, half bewildered at the eleven year old enamored by his severely autistic daughter. I felt awkward and left, saddened and angered by the realization that my soulmate turned out to be a retard.</p>
<p>It would have never worked out anyway, the RV door had an unpleasant pitch when it opened. I could never be with a girl with a father that had an RV with a door that had unpleasent pitch when opened, it just wouldn’t work. I’m not picky but there are some things you just cant tolerate.</p>
<p>Later that day I asked my mom about the girl. “What do you think is wrong with that girl?”, I said. “She is disabled or autistic or something”, she said. I had hoped for validation that this girl wasn’t disabled, that she was normal, that she was amazing. But all I got was validation that I had liked a retard.</p>
<p>I felt stupid and really really angry. Inside I was terrified that this girl was like me. I resolved that I was not autistic and that autistic people were retarded. I’d never be like that — I wasn’t anything like that.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of that trip contemplating how much I was and wasn’t like that girl. I alternated between convincing myself she was misunderstood and that no one got her and convincing myself that she was a retard. Accepting she was retarded meant accepting I had been an idiot for not recognizing a girl was disabled. But accepting she was misunderstood meant that I was like her, one odd behavior away from being retarded. I wasn’t autistic, I wasn’t retarded. I was normal and awesome socially! I only had one friend really, but he thought I was awesome! Autistic people are terrible at social things. I cant be autistic. Plus, autistic people have like weird interests and shit and cant talk to people.</p>
<p>That road-trip was to the National Checkers Championship. I was a checkers prodigy. *</p>
<p>I resolved to never be autistic, to never be retarded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not joking at all. If you don’t believe me do a google search, checkers is a serious game, it just has an image problem – one so bad I need to add a footnote to specify I wasn’t joking.</li>

<li>Start on backend code for GetGoodAt. Just didn’t get to it. sad llama</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m really starting to be driven insane by the lack of design tools that work well with code. I want to prototype frontend and backend and experiment with design stuff all at the same time. Today with GetGoodAt I really wanted to just dive and experiment with stuff, but so much code needs to come into place before I can start playing with design. I could Sketch or Photoshop or draw but that doesn’t allow one to explore properly, it still feels broken.</p>
<p>No one is ever going to build what I need I think. So, I must build it myself. Sqircle is going to be prototyped this weekend if it’s the last thing I do.</p>
<p>It was raining off and on today so I didn’t make much use of newly arrived camera. Ended up taking mostly selfies and images of chess pieces. Here is a selfie <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hXOxGjJl.jpg" alt="Selfie"></p>

I just bought a Sony a6000 and today the lens comes. Finally getting into photography a tiny bit. Bought it mostly so I can document an upcoming to trip Columbia and Bolivia. One cannot take a trip to South America and not document it. At least it is a good excuse to finally get a decent potato. One needs good excuses to do things. Life is made from good excuses.</p>
<p>My neck hurts this morning. I think I managed to sleep upside down or something. Don’t laugh. I do that a lot. I’m not sure why but I sleep interesting, always have. I have a theory derived from conversations with similar sleeping humans. I think it has to do with a combination of a tendency to sleep soundly but also not fall into a deep sleep. I’m half awake most of the night and it leads to me moving around in all sorts of weird ways.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to title these Daily Authenticity posts. I thought numbers at first, e.g &quot;Daily Authenticity Day 1&quot;, but then it is hard to split them up into two posts. I have decided to use “Beginning” and “End” for now and see how that works. Beginning, denotes the start and end denotes well the end.</p>

I would like to say that I learned gradually the social ways of the world and when things were appropriate to say and when they weren’t. That is not what happened. Instead years of emotional abuse and trauma created someone unable to say anything at all. Instead of learning social skills and becoming more developed as a human being; I stopped talking, I stopped sharing. I became chronically paranoid that people would act terribly if I said or did something &quot;wrong&quot;. At times I became convinced I was &quot;bad&quot;.</p>
<p>My inability to be myself has become paralyzing. Countless actions are avoided, endless opportunities are never pursued, friendships are never made, projects are ruined because of communication problems, side-projects never launched because of fear.</p>
<p>I’m tired of being this way. I want to be a person that feels comfortable with who they are. I want to be comfortable with me. I want to send emails to people without terror. I want to communicate when projects are going wrong and not wait too long. I want to pursue friendships and opportunities without being paralyzed by a fear of rejection. I want to stop feeling shame over my mental illness. I want to stop feeling anxiety over my autistic traits. I want to be a person that acts like me and not someone else. I want to be authentic.</p>
<p>I have learned from dealing with my other anxieties that exposure is the only cure. You have to train your brain that things will be okay. Then when things don’t go terribly wrong your brain is like &quot;oh, I was so silly&quot;. Gradually, you become accustomed to the behaviors, to the environments, and you are no longer made anxious by those things.</p>
<p>I’m going to start blogging daily about what I’m up to. There will be two posts; one in the morning summarizing what I plan to do and one at the end of the day talking about what I did. Sometimes they will be simple task lists, sometimes deeply personal, usually somewhere in between. Some of them will be poorly written, some will be epic high quality posts that take me hours. At first most will be rushed to meet the goal of posting twice daily, but eventually I hope to get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Why not just keep a journal? I have and while it is great for self-accountability and reflection it does nothing to eliminate anxieties. I have deep deep anxieties about many many things. I have found the best cure is to give them a voice, to talk about them. When I talk about them they lose their power, they become silly and ridiculous and I can let go of them.</p>
<p>When I wrote <a href="http://fighttheurgetofade.com">FightTheUrgeToFade</a> half my brain expected terrible things to happen. I had so much shame over who I was. All my fear and anxieties made me think that certainly bad things would happen. Nothing bad happened. When nothing bad happened, my brain stopped fearing talking about the stuff, all the anxieties I had ended up feeling silly. I stopped feeling shame over my mental illness and became able to talk about the stuff, and the anxieties went away.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to be a little more authentic every day and if I’m lucky it will make all my anxieties and fears start to seem silly. It wont be others it will be for me. I will grow by sharing, even if I’m sharing with a void. Authenticity is as much about getting to know yourself as it is letting others get to know you.</p>
]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">Daily Authenticity</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[K-2052]]></dc:creator></item><item><title><![CDATA[Everything is a Story]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This was written for someone that asked me for writing advice once. I’m only posting it now because I have been told it was helpful. I don’t feel qualified to give writing tips. I have written a few terrible technical books, okay tutorials, and a popular blog post about being mentally ill once. That doesn’t make me feel qualified to give writing advice at all, but I guess no writer ever feels qualified.</p>
<p>One time someone asked me “who are you?” and I replied &quot;seventh&quot;. They laughed and one of them said &quot;I feel that&quot;. They thought I was making some deep commentary on the middle school experience, but really my brain had malfunctioned. I had been constantly asked what grade I was in that evening and I had lost the ability to distinguish questions. For weeks and even years after that humans at youth group called me &quot;seventh&quot;.</p>
<p>Questions about who you are just get harder. No one knows what to put in the “About Me” section. When confronted with it, we long for times when we could describe ourselves as our grade. Who are you?</p>
<p>The most powerful lesson you will ever learn for writing is that everything is a story; even non-fiction. I don’t mean that everything is magical or fantastical, has swashbuckling pirates and dragons, puns about King Arthur, a princess named Buttercup, or time traveling women hooking up with hot bearded Scottish men. I just mean that everything fits a story, even stuff that doesn’t have a story is given one by the reader.</p>
<p>Take the driest most non-fiction information imaginable, for example, the weather; none of us looks up the weather for the weather, we look it up because it fits into a story, our own narrative. We might plan to ski on Sunday, or go to the beach on the Friday, or want to dance with a girl in the rain on Thursday. We give the weather meaning. We know that if it is cold we will need a sweater, if it is going to be hot we might need to skip the skiing, and if it is going to rain we will need to change our romantic gesture to win over the manic pixie rollerblading dream girl from a picnic to like meeting under and umbrella at 3:30. Weather is just the information we use tell our own the story. Non-fiction is just as much as a story as any fiction, non-fiction just lets the reader tell more of it.</p>
<p>Non-fiction questions like “About Me” are hard because readers come to you with a thousand expectations. Who is this human? Where are they going? Why do I keep seeing these gnomes? Do I have ball cancer? Is it gonna rain? IS NO ONE ELSE SEEING THESE GOD DAMN GNOMES?!!! I hope they give a talk and open up about how they two see the gnomes. Or maybe at least some tips on folding paper towels or something.</p>
<p>Non-fiction stories are the hardest to tell. You cant just throw in some gnomes, some dragons or like a mysterious delivery of yellow bouncy balls every month for 8 years followed by a single red one at which point the delivery stops. Non-fiction has to answer questions. The first step, is to figure out the questions then tell a story around them.</p>
<p>All the tools you would use to tell a story are the same ones you should be using to write non-fiction.</p>
<p>I think most struggle with non-fiction because they are terrible at picking out the real questions. When asked “who are you?” The default response is; I’m a male hominid, have four limbs, from the planet earth, 6’3, 240 pounds, loves animals and helping creatures, likes pizza and sushi, eats too much pizza.</p>
<p>When we ask dry questions we are inspired to write dry things. Good writing is about asking the right questions. Once you ask the right questions then everything flows. The right questions for anything are the same questions you would ask for fiction, only about you or the thing.</p>
<p>How would a novel answer &quot;who is x&quot;? They wouldn’t tell us with facts and stats, they would show who they are through a story.</p>
<p>This can be hard, because few of us our taught to be good storytellers. Fortunately, all of us have heard a lot of stories, because as you might recall, everything is story. All we need is a few pointers to pull out storytelling techniques and everything just &quot;clicks&quot;. We know what a good story looks like (which is why we suffer from blocks, if we didn’t know the story was bad we’d have no blocks, we’d just write the dry versions). All it takes is a bit of practice to bring our taste and skill closer.</p>
<p>Every character story is a hero’s journey. Every story about anyone ever can be broken down into the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>A character is in a zone of comfort,</li>
<li>But they want something.</li>
<li>They enter an unfamiliar situation,</li>
<li>Adapt to it,</li>
<li>Get what they wanted,</li>
<li>Pay a heavy price for it,</li>
<li>Then return to their familiar situation,</li>
<li>Having changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Read this for more http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit</p>
<p>Even non-fiction fits this, especially personal narratives. Take for example, a college application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bob is stuck at home</li>
<li>Bob wants to save and help animals</li>
<li>They intend to enter college</li>
<li>Learn to adult</li>
<li>Change the world</li>
<li>Get student debt</li>
<li>Return to their life</li>
<li>With world changing skills and a lot of debt, like seriously a lot of debt</li>
</ol>
<p>I know, this all sounds way oversimplified. Even stories can come with huge writer’s block. That chick that wrote To Kill a Mockingbird took like 40 years to write a sequel. And that guy that wrote that book about that angry teen catching things in a wheat field? He like never wrote another thing, like ever.</p>
<p>The secret to every story is that it is made of smaller stories. The smaller the story the more obvious it is to write. You just have to break up the story into smaller and smaller parts. Get the story small enough and it will write itself. Anyone can write what the weather is.</p>
<p>We are all storytellers. Figure out the story. Try to tell a good one.</p>

<p>When I was a kid I hated word problems, they drove me insane. Word problems took math, which was fun, and turned it into a hellscape of word play and misdirection. Instead of data and variables, I had to play a game of decipher and find the data. I hated world problems and it took me years to get comfortable with them.</p>
<p>You know the ones I’m talking about. They sound like this (you can skip the next 500 words)</p>
<p>Claire gets to the airport at 5:45am, going to visit her boyfriend Chad in up state New York. At 5:30am Claire’s best friend Drew sees the note she left in January but he never got because his comic relief roommate Cheese knocked over the table while playing a game of hockey in the kitchen; which meant this particular letter had slid beneath the far right cupboard. Claire thought Drew had ignored her letter. Claire thought the feelings weren’t mutual. Now Claire is leaving and Drew is passed out on the kitchen floor from last night’s <em>try to forget Claire drunken escapades</em> – when he sees the letter beneath the cupboard. He reads the letter and begins crying. It is now 5:45am and Drew is trying to find his pants and keys, but what he cant remember is that last night he left his keys with a golden retriever.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, while eating, Drew will remember that last night he played fetch with a golden retriever outside a french restaurant at 3am. This is something you should not do, especially when your keychain has a small bouncy ball and the golden retriever is a professional ball thief.</p>
<p>It is now 6am and the living room looks like the aftermath of either a Pillowstown vs Blanketsburg war or a spontaneous couch explosion. Drew has given up on finding his keys and is trying to use the Uber app with one hand while eating a 2 day old muffin with the other. He drops the muffin, leaves it on the floor and rushes out the door. Cheese will pick up this muffin for breakfast later. Claire isn’t answering texts. 6:30am and the Uber leaves with a Drew that forgot to put on deadorant. Still no reply. Drew remembers the 400 drunk texts he sent ranting about Chad and realizes that is probably it.</p>
<p>3am last night…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>omg you won’t believe this golden outside La Food! he is playing fetch with my keys!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>La Food, the same restaurant where she realized she loved him back in October. The same restaurant where she wrote him the note he ignored. It is 3am and Claire mutes Drew.</p>
<p>It is 7am and Drew is stuck in traffic in the passenger side of a Prius with an Uber driver that keeps talking about his education startup.</p>
<p>Don’t worry Drew will make it. This is post 9/11 and Claire wont board for another 2 hours. One hour waiting in line next to some backpackers that haven’t showered in 8 weeks and begin every sentence with &quot;dude&quot;, 30 minutes of being groped by creepy TSA agents, 15 minutes paying for a $57 dollar sandwich, on her flight by 8:30. Don’t you just love Dulles.</p>
<p>7:45am, the Uber arrives at the airport. A very smelly Drew has travelled 30 miles. For the first part of the trip, the average speed was 45mph. Then the sportsball team lost and the rest of trip was at an average speed of 5mph.</p>
<p>For how long did the Uber drive at each speed?</p>
<p>The problem with word problems is they are full of data you don’t need. Unintentionally or intentionally written in a way that obscures what they are. If you were just given the distance, rate, and time it would be easy to solve. You learn to rewrite them, to pick them apart and quickly get what you need.</p>
<p>Interview puzzles are like word problems. Once you understand them they tend to be rather straightforward. The only reason they are hard is because the skills needed to pick apart an interview challenge are not the same ones you use to pick apart and breakdown a real world problem.</p>
<p>Let’s take a typical challenge from Codility <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/task/frog_river_one">Frog river one</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is currently located at position 0, and wants to get to position X. Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.</p>
<p>You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.</p>
<p>The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X. You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.</p>
<p>For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1<br>
A[1] = 3<br>
A[2] = 1<br>
A[3] = 4<br>
A[4] = 2<br>
A[5] = 3<br>
A[6] = 5<br>
A[7] = 4<br>
In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>def solution(x, a)</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return −1.</p>
<p>For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1<br>
A[1] = 3<br>
A[2] = 1<br>
A[3] = 4<br>
A[4] = 2<br>
A[5] = 3<br>
A[6] = 5<br>
A[7] = 4<br>
the function should return 6, as explained above.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p>N and X are integers within the range [1…100,000];<br>
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1…X].</p>
<p>Complexity:</p>
<p>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);<br>
expected worst-case space complexity is O(X), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).</p>
<p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>1. Don’t Solve it. Describe the problem</h2>
<p>Let’s describe this problem in a way that is clearer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have an unordered stack of numbers to go through. You can only cross the river when you have counted numbers in a sequence up to a specified number. To cross you must know where you stopped counting.</p>
<p>For example, if you had the following numbers [1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4] and you were counting to five, then six (your stack of numbers is zero indexed) would be the answer to cross the river.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When described this way the solution should come to you instantly. But don’t solve it just yet.</p>
<h2>2. Don’t Solve It. Do it manually</h2>
<p>Now that you have described the problem, you can write out a manual solution. Often but not always, this manual solution is already available to you in the problem’s description, you just need to rip it out. For example, our Frog Jump River problem is simply:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">x = 5
a = [1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Look through numbers <code>a</code> until every number up to and including 5 <code>x</code> has appeared; when this happens, record where the number was and use that to cross the river.</p>
<p>This is a very simple example. The more complex the case the more important this manual step will be. This step does two things;</p>
<ol>
<li>It makes sure your math is right. In this case it is just a simple equal sign but it can be a lot more complicated.</li>
<li>It helps reveal the data structures you will need. In this example most of the data is decided for us, we only generate one new thing, an int.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3. Solve… Kidding Don’t Solve it yet either. Figure out the data structures</h2>
<p>First let’s work out the inputs. The data types of the inputs were given to us in the problem definition. We receive an int denoting the number we have to look for and an array of numbers to look through:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">x : int
a : array
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to work the structures for any state we accumulate. We need to hold a list of all the numbers we have seen. We can hold them in a set:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">seen : Set
</code></pre>
<p>And finally our output; the number we use to cross:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elm">position : int
</code></pre>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>The solution should be obvious by now. We can write it in seconds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'set'
def solution(x, a)
  seen = Set.new
  a.each_with_index do |value, index|
    seen &lt;&lt; value
    if seen.length == x
      return index
    end
  end

  return -1
end
</code></pre>

<p>tl/dr</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the problem</li>
<li>Do it manually</li>
<li>Figure out the data structures</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the approach I’m using to tackle all my training for getting better at interview challenges. I have started a repo <a href="https://github.com/k2052/interview-challenge-walkthroughs">interview-challenge-walkthroughs</a> where I document working through challenges in this exact way. Every challenge has a Markdown file where I describe the problem, manually solve it, work out the data structures and then finally arrive at a solution.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of interview puzzle solution resources out there, even dedicated blogs and sites to them; they all focus on the solution itself. They rarely cover how to arrive at the solution. They miss the most important part of interview challenges, the process leading up to the solution. The solutions are easy, the hard part is the solving. I think this gap is why being terrible at interviews is so common. We focus on mastering and practicing solutions instead of solving. Change a puzzle just slightly and most will be lost. But that is a subject for <a href="http://journal.2052.me/Im-Terrible-at-Interviews.html">another time</a></p>

<p>You just made a thing. You want to tell humans about the thing. You send an email about the thing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey dude, here is this thing I made. I was wondering what you thought of it? Could you take a look?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You regret this email immediately. Your thing is terrible, you realize this now. You start to worry that everyone will discover you are terrible. You just wasted this human’s time. Your work is terrible. You are terrible.</p>
<p>The next day you wake up to a hundred mentions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey dude, I saw your thing! What is this shit?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Haha look at this guy and his crappy work</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know right. This guy is terrible. His work is terrible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone hates you and everyone has discovered you are a fraud. Everyone knows you suck.</p>
<p>You close off twitter and go into work. Everyone is gathered around Jerry’s desk. <em>Jerry, I fucking hate that guy.</em> They are laughing at something. You get a bottle of hint water, a donut, and make your way over to see what all the fuss is about. Then you see it, your work on a 30 inch cinema, more pixels to see more of how terrible you are, more viewing angles so more humans can see that you are a fraud. They are laughing at you. Now they know you are a fraud too. You leave early that day.</p>
<p>You get home to an email from your CEO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, can you jump back on Slack for a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fired over Slack. Then your house burns down. Then during a google hangout with a bearded Swedish guy from a cool new hip startup – you forget to put on pants. He cracks a joke about how even in Sweden they put on clothes sometimes. You don’t get that job. Your cat dies. You become homeless. One day Jerry runs across you begging for change and he hands you a dollar.</p>
<p>This is silly. This would never happen but this is how my brain works. This is what I worry about, so I do what is easiest, I avoid things.</p>
<p>The summer I was six some kids convinced me the pipe that ran on the lakebed could suck you in. &quot;If you aren’t careful it can pull you in&quot;, they said. For weeks every time we went to the lake I was convinced I could be sucked in at any moment. I carefully avoided the pipe and always swam swiftly over top of its location. When I’d forget and end up above it, it would send me into a panic and I would swim away as fast I could.</p>
<p>I tried convincing myself that everything was fine and that it was silly to think I could be sucked into a pipe but to a six year old a dangerously placed pipe at the bottom of a swimming area seemed reasonable. Incompetent adults surely cared so little for the safety of children that they would do such a thing without a second thought. It seemed plausible enough to me.</p>
<p>Try as I might, I could not get rid of the fear of that pipe. I could not forgot about it. I could not push it from my mind. I became controlled by the fear that this pipe would suck me in. Swimming that summer became defined by all the rituals I would go through to help with my anxiety. I’d always make sure I knew where the pipe was. I always made sure to swim over it as fast as possible. I made sure I never drifted over it and that I always had a line of sight to an adult so I could scream for help, in case the pipe suddenly powered up or something. My anxiety took control of me and ruined my ability to enjoy swimming for weeks and weeks.</p>
<p>Then something strange happened, I realized that it wouldn’t be so bad being sucked into a pipe. Sure, I would probably drown and die but it wouldn’t matter, I’d just be dead. Suddenly I was free from the anxiety. I realized that it no longer had any control over me. I stopped being frightened by it and I got my summer back.</p>
<p>That summer never really stuck as a life lesson. It was just the way I defeated the lake monster, it was how I got my summer back. I stopped caring about the worst case scenario and suddenly I was free.</p>
<p>I’m in a constant war against anxieties, they are monsters always lurking; underneath beds, in closets, on the bottom of lakes. I have setup countless defenses to keep them at bay. I have built blanket forts, I have taken pills, I have adopted self-care and excercise regiments that make me stronger. I constantly remind my brain that &quot;they aren’t real&quot;. I’m terrified that they are real. I’m terrified of the worst that could happen happening. I’m terrified of emails resulting in me being discovered as terrible. I’m terrified of a pipe on the bottom of a lake sucking me in.</p>
<p>In July I played in the World chess Open (U1800). In the 3rd round I was outplayed by someone much stronger than me (big opens attract the underrated – I’m not the only that takes longs breaks from rated play) and this sent my emotions spiraling. When I sat down to the next game I was an anxious wreck. I was terrified of losing. I was terrified of messing up. I was determined to not mess up. I blundered horribly and lost the game while executing a winning a tactic. My anxiety killed my game.</p>
<p>I went back to my hotel room pissed. I was so angry at myself. I was so disappointed. I regretted ever having taken up chess again. Then something happened, I realized it didn’t matter if I lost. I was 25, I was no longer a strong junior (relatively) hoping for a scholarship one day, I was a slightly above average player, I wasn’t losing anything when I lost a chess game (except maybe some prize money). It didn’t matter if I lost, it didn’t even matter if I won. The only thing that mattered is what I wanted to take from the experience. I realized I just wanted to enjoy the game. Suddenly I didn’t need to worry about the anxiety either. What did it matter if I got anxious and lost? Who cares!</p>
<p>I proceeded to win all my next games. Most importantly, I finally enjoyed the game again. I didn’t care about winning or losing or fucking up. I just cared about making the best moves I could. I gave myself permission to feel anxious, to fail, to do whatever the hell I wanted and it freed me. Suddenly my love for chess returned. I felt like a beginner again with nothing to prove myself or anyone else. I could just play. And I played pretty well.</p>
<p>I have spent most of my life desperately avoiding failure. I became so defined by my desire to avoid a failing business and college that I became a shut-in. I did the greatest avoidance of all, I tried to not exist.</p>
<p>Although I left that shut-in life behind, the last few years have been defined by the same sort of avoidance. I avoid sending emails. I avoid sending job apps. I avoid interviews. I avoid success just as much as I avoid failure.</p>
<p>The measures I have taken to prevent anxiety have become the cause of it. I’m too anxious to try another interview so I don’t get a job, which makes me broke, which makes it hard to afford things, which makes me unable to do things, which makes me stressed. I’m in a constant vicious cycle where avoiding things makes me more likely to avoid things.</p>
<p>I cant go on like this. I have decided to end it at the source, to stop avoiding things. I will do the reverse of what I have done previously. I will organize my life around doing the things that I would otherwise avoid. I will send the emails first. I will apply to jobs first not later. I will reach out and network and be myself. I will be brave.</p>
<p>Humans are wired for a time when the worst happening meant death or starvation. But stuff like not getting a job, losing the chess game, messing up an interview, even homelessness these aren’t things to fear like death or starvation. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad anymore.</p>
<p>Do you know who disproportionately are the biggest entreprenuers? The wealthy. They don’t fear less, they have to less fear. They aren’t risk seekers, they have less risk. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad for them. Want to be like them? Accept your worst case scenario just as they accepted theirs. Their worst case might be a studio apartment but yours might be homelessness. You can survive homelessness. You can go for it!</p>
<p>When you realize that you can survive the worst that could happen you become free. You suddenly have permission to just be. You can send the email. You can apply for the dream job. You can quit the job and pursue the dream. You can take risks in the chess game. You can tell the girl you like them, You can tell the boy you like them. You can travel to far away lands. You can swim across the monster at the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>You can do this not because you are fearless but because fear has lost its meaning. What if the worst that could happen happened? Everything would be fine. It wouldn’t stop you.</p>

<p>I was doing great! I was winning! Then I wasn’t. Then I was losing. Then I was nearly crying and dragging myself up from the depth of emotions back to a draw. I was better than this guy! I could do it! I wasn’t going to lose! Then it was over. Handshake. Scoresheets signed.</p>
<p>My first rated chess game against an adult was over.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what opening that was right?&quot;, I said. I’m gonna educate this patzer I thought.<br>
&quot;Yes, of course! The Vienna game – Steinitz gambit&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>I walked away wondering how he knew so much. Must have been a fluke I thought. I got this. I’m only 12! I’m gonna be a GM by the time I’m 15 and then world champion! I was 15 by the time I realized the significance of what he said.</p>
<h2>Being Terrible</h2>
<p>I had my second real interview at 24 <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. I was nervous out of my mind and spent the night (okay days) before practicing and rehearsing social skills and topics of discussion. I was massively prepared! I was going to ace whatever coding challenge they threw at me! Palindromes?! Haha! I laugh in the face of palindromes! Linked lists?! I can link a list in my sleep. FizzBuzz?! Don’t make me chuckle.</p>
<p>There was no coding challenge.</p>
<p>I sailed through an interview about my work and tackled their trial run with ease. Their CEO was impressed and they flew me out to SF for a week in the office. He was less impressed when he realized that in person I’m incredibly awkward and socially inept. Despite my lack of social skills and bewilderment at whiteboarding during code reviews, I was able to impress the CEO with my speed and code quality. I thought I had this job for sure!</p>
<p>Then came the disappointing email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are sorry but at this time we cant extend you a full time offer. But we could off you some further contract work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fired back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks man, but I’m going to pursue full time opportunities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t want to waste my time on further contract work. I was an awesome coder! I would have a job in no time!</p>
<p>My third interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you explain Angular controllers to us?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>umm… Yeah I guess… umm… umm… ummm… ummm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the disappointing (but not surprising) email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have decided to pursue other candidates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have this palindrome problem we’d like you to work through</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>okay… umm… I think I need to reverse the string first? no sure about the performance of this though…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is fine if you brute force first</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ummm… how are are we for time? um… sorry I’m bombing. what did you say again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the disappointing email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We feel you are not right for us at this time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fifth interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want you to whiteboard for us</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Umm I cant do that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have decided that you aren’t a good fit right now. Send in your app again maybe when you have brushed up on your whiteboarding skills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on and on it went like that until I gave up. I was disgusted with myself, disappointed, and depressed. How was I so bad at coding challenges? How was I so bad at interviews? How was it every one thought I was great at coding until they interviewed me? Why did I keep bombing so bad? I know I’m decent at coding. It must be the pressure. I’m terrible under pressure. I just suck at interviews.</p>
<h2>Get Smarter Every day</h2>
<p>One of my favorite YouTube channels is &quot;Smarter Every day&quot;. In one experiment, they took a bike and reversed its steering, so that when you turned it to the left it went to the right and when you turned it to the right well, you get it.</p>
<div class="videoWrapper">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFzDaBzBlL0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>The challenge was to ride it. It seems simple. The knowledge to ride the bike takes mere seconds to grasp – it is just like a normal bike but opposite. A funny thing happens though, you cant ride it; no matter how hard anyone tried they could not ride it. It takes Dustin (the creator of the channel) months to learn to ride it.</p>
<p>I think the most important take away from this is not that people cant ride a backwards bike; it is that <em>we think we can ride a backwards bike</em>. This fact reveals a whole class of invisible problems on the road to mastery of anything.</p>
<p>Knowledge != understanding, but because knowledge is how we articulate understanding we often confuse the two. When we are asked “how did you do that?” our response is to express the knowledge we have. We cant convey the understanding we have. This makes it very easy to fall into the trap that once you acquire the same knowledge that you have the same understanding. It is really easy to think you can ride a backwards bike.</p>
<h2>The time I realized everyone was a lot better than I thought</h2>
<p>Many tournaments after that first one…</p>
<p>I was winning! Then I wasn’t. Then I lost. This shouldn’t have happened! I was way better than this guy! I had spent so much time studying. I had become so good! So knowledgeable! But I lost.</p>
<p>That tournament was a disaster. I messed up so much and finished far below where I thought I would.</p>
<p>I thought, maybe I shouldn’t have drank the mountain dew. I shouldn’t have ate so many cookies. I should have followed my thinking process. I should have asked the TD to dim the lights. It must have been the lights.</p>
<p>When I sat down to analyze the game, I discovered something strange. This guy knew just as much as I did. He was familiar with the opening. His middlegame understanding was great. His planning was superior. His knowledge was just as good mine if not better.</p>
<p>It would have been easy to explain this away, to think he was underrated and that I was still as strong as I thought. But I had a revelation that day. I thought to myself, what if ratings are accurate? What if this guy really knew a lot more than me and what if I really wasn’t as strong as I thought? But if knowledge didn’t make people stronger what did?</p>
<p>I started to look more objectively at my games. I started to realize that my opponents very rarely beat me because of superior knowledge, they almost always beat me because they were more accurate, their technique was better, or they simply made one less mistake. I realized that I lost because of less understanding. There was a huge gap between how much I knew and my ability to put that knowledge into practice.</p>
<p>I begin to realize that technique wasn’t just a small part of chess, that it was actually the heart of it. Knowledge was easy, but actually really truly knowing something took a lot more time. I had spent years of my chess career focused on all the wrong things. I had devoured book after after book, spent hours upon hours reading but still found myself ranking below juniors that seemed to work way less hard than I did.</p>
<p>I had a lot of knowledge but little understanding and it was impossible to put any of that knowledge into practice because my lack of understanding would cause me to slip up. It was no use knowing at a high level when my lack of understanding would make it impossible to use that knowledge. It took the revelation that lots of people had a high level of knowledge to realize what I was missing was understanding. I knew a lot of chess but I didn’t <em>understand</em> nearly as much.</p>
<h2>Why you suck</h2>
<p>How quickly could you solve FizzBuzz without having ever seen it? Most of us like to think we could solve it instantly and most of us can. But if you had never seen it before could you really solve it in just a couple minutes?</p>
<p>It took a few interview failures for me to decide to practice. I started with very simple challenges. What I discovered shocked me, they took me a lot of time. It often took me half an hour or more to solve problems I had convinced myself I could solve in seconds. There was a huge disconnect between my knowledge and my understanding.</p>
<p>I had come out of interviews convinced that there must be something externally wrong because I was convinced that my knowledge was the same as understanding. I could figure out how to solve FizzBuzz in my sleep but there is a big gap between knowing how to solve a problem and being able to solve a problem.</p>
<p>You want to hack together a quick script. What language do you choose? I’d bet it is not the language you work with on your day job. I bet it is not even the best choice. If I was asked why I chose a language, without missing a beat I’d answer &quot;Because I know it best&quot;. You would probably answer the same.</p>
<p>Now try to articulate why you know it better than another language. Is it because you know the syntax better? Is it because you know how to implement some pattern in it? Think about it for a moment and you will realize you probably know how to implement that pattern in many languages. And you probably know the syntax of other languages pretty well too. Then, why do you feel you know <em>x</em> language better?</p>
<p>I know many languages but when I hack something up I always use Ruby. Why? Because I understand Ruby. It isn’t that I know Ruby any better than say ES6. It is that I have all this surrounding knowledge, all these accumulated little things, that make working with Ruby easier, more productive, and generally less frustrating. If I say choose, for example, ES6, my brain knows that there will be friction. I might be able to write the same code in ES6 but getting to the point where it runs, where it works, where all my dependencies are there and working, all this might take me a lot longer in ES6.</p>
<p>Most of programming is invisible. Working with package managers, configuring and using editors, shortcuts, detecting stack problems and honing on the problem area, deciphering error messages, being able to detect when you are missing a semi-colon etc. These are all things that just happen, that your brain does automatically, that enable you to work faster, smarter, better.</p>
<p>When you lack understanding you can’t make use of your knowledge because you end up spending most of your time fighting against the unexpected. You keep forgetting the bike is backwards and have to catch your balance over and over.</p>
<p>When you learn a new stack you can see the things that were invisible. Suddenly things are frustrating again, you are hitting invisible pains everywhere; package manager explosions, cryptic error messages, libraries with unintuitive APIs, even documentation that reads differently. Learning a new stack makes you see the invisible again, for awhile, then we forget about it again.</p>
<p>Interviews are full of invisible knowledge, little things that turn FizzBuzz like challenges from a 30 minute headache to something done in seconds. In the typical interview challenge you have to;</p>
<h3>1. Become familiar with the live coding tool or screensharing you are going to use.</h3>
<p>Every interviewer is different, with different preferences, so welcome to a whole new world every time. If you are lucky this is a one time thing that you master in the first couple of minutes, but 40% of the time in the middle of the interview your tool is going to freeze up or crash and you are going to have to restart Skype, the Atom plugin, some web app etc.</p>
<h3>2. Understand how to communicate with the interviewer.</h3>
<p>Everyone has their own communication style and you will spend the first 10-15 minutes of any interview getting used to it. If you are lucky he will be a good interviewer and communicate what he wants from you but most will not. You will have to settle in and figure out whether he is a “show me” type, a “tell me” type, or a “confused and bewildered” by everything type.</p>
<h3>3. You have to get comfortable and get in the zone.</h3>
<p>Once you have done the previous two things, you have to ramp up, to get in the zone and get comfortable communicating and coding with the interviewer. I’m not going to lie, I have a huge ramp up time. It takes me a lot of time to warm up and be comfortable around a person. If my initial interview is with a different person than handles my coding challenge, I get incredibly nervous. By the time I have gotten comfortable I have burned through 30 minutes of time and I’m staring to look and feel like I’m a bad coder.</p>
<p>The previous two tasks can really interfere with getting in the zone, so protip, if you are interviewer eliminate them. Tell them ahead of time what to expect from the interview and what technology will be used. Eliminate the friction and pain point of that interview and your coder will perform optimally. Of course, better yet, hire your coders through a trial process.</p>
<h3>4. You have to breakdown the problem.</h3>
<p>When we encounter truly different problems, like a google type algorithm challenge we can recognize our lack of understanding. The trouble happens when we encounter stuff like FizzBuzz or &quot;find the longest palindrome&quot;. They seem obvious to us and we never bother truly mastering how to break down a problem like it.</p>
<p>FizzBuzz can seem a lot like what we do everyday but it really isn’t. Most of my day is spent configuring dependencies, finding libraries, writing React views etc. FizzBuzz type problems are nothing like that. I know how to solve FizzBuzz but I don’t (at least not then) <em>understand</em> it. Not like I understand React or npm or redux reducers or Sinatra or Rack or Express.</p>
<p>Interview challenges are like a backwards bike. You can think you understand them because you know them. You don’t though. They look like the same thing but they are not. The disconnect between your knowledge and your understanding creates a ton of problems.</p>
<h3>5. You have to be familiar with the tools needed to solve the problem.</h3>
<p>This the hardest and most invisible part of interview challenges. I thought my knowledge had this covered perfectly but I didn’t. Most of the patterns you use to solve everyday programming challenges are not the same ones you will use to solve an interviewer’s challenge. There are all these invisible little things that we use to solve interview type challenges that most of the time we just forget about.</p>
<p>When was the last time you even reversed a string in a real project? You probably cant remember. Maybe it was days, maybe weeks, maybe months. So you google and read the docs – there goes 30 seconds and you haven’t even reversed a string yet.</p>
<p>How do you calculate permutations again? Oh that’s right, I did that once a long time ago. time 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Wait, can I use built in libraries? I can. Phew. I sorta know how to do that but there is no way I could figure it out on my own right now. 5 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
<p>You haven’t even started on the real heart of the problem yet and the stress is building because you look and feel like an idiot that cant program.</p>
<p>We can use the built in libraries but we cant use eval. How do we avoid eval? Oh that is right, we use send! send is just a method on Object I think – it takes a symbol – but how do I dynamically calculate a symbol again? oh, we just take a string and to_sym it, god how did I forget that. wait, I bet send actually takes a string anyway. 20 minutes.</p>
<p>How did this take me so long to figure out? I’m an idiot. fuck.</p>
<p>This is how interviews go wrong. This is how you mess them up.</p>
<h2>It is easy to think it’s easy</h2>
<p>Last summer was tough, really tough. I had expected to sail through interviews but found myself struggling and imploding at every attempt. I kept failing. I hated myself. I doubted myself. I wondered if I was ever going to get my life under control. I worried about ever getting good enough at the “social things” to get a job and make a livable income. I was exhausted by contract work and I was exhausted by job hunting.</p>
<p>At first I blamed it on “nerves” or stressors. I thought if I just fixed the environmental factors that the next interview would go perfect. All I needed was to be rested, or prepared, or not drink too much caffeine before and then it would go smooth. But they didn’t, they kept going wrong.</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand it, I knew how to do things but under pressure I couldn’t. It took me several bad interviews to finally realize that I didn’t understand how to solve these type of interview challenges. I had the knowledge but not the understanding.</p>
<p>Just like in chess, 99% of these challenges take invisible skills. They took understanding I did not have. If the interviewers had asked me build a TodoMVC in React I would have flown through it. Find the longest palindrome type stuff tripped me up because I had little of the invisible knowledge needed to solve them effectively.</p>
<p>In an interview you cant eat up even 30 minutes on something like FizzBuzz. If you do then you now have another problem, you are running low on time. And running low on time creates more problems, it makes it harder to focus, it gives you less time to work through the rest of your problem. Now you are intentionally rushing and skipping points and trying to get to solution and wondering if the interviewer is looking for problem solving skills or a successful solution and too afraid to ask because that could eat up more time.</p>
<p>Just like in a chess game, the micro skills add up. If you had all the little skills it would be easy but without them it is kind of actually <em>hard</em>. Every little moment of friction adds up; 30 seconds of googling there, a struggle with a method there, trying to understand the performance implications there, remembering how to reverse a string there. It all adds up and before long it spirals out of control and you have lost the chess game, you have failed the interview.</p>
<p>Nerves are a symptom not the cause. Anyone gets nervous when their knowledge turns out to be a lack of understanding. You get stressed because you have keep falling off the backwards bike. Anyone would get frustrated and start to feel like an idiot. This seems obvious! But I cant seem to get it!</p>
<p>The trick is to not get angry, to not blame the failures on symptoms, to recognize the lack of understanding and to correct it. You have to realize a backwards bike is actually hard to ride. Then you pick yourself up and you practice every day for five minutes. Until one day, it clicks, and you finally get it. You are riding! Suddenly the knowledge becomes understanding, and “find the longest palindrome” becomes something you just do, it becomes like just riding a bike.</p>
<h2>How I’m going to get better</h2>
<p>I’m making a commitment to get better. To make interview challenges more intuitive. To master the fundamentals and make “find the longest palindrome” second nature. I want to get a job. I want to stop messing up and get my life on track. I want interview challenges to feel like riding a bike.</p>
<p>Programming is about data manipulation. Every problem is a challenge of taking one form of data (inputs) and transforming it into another form (outputs). I have broken it down into the following;</p>
<h3>1. Math and Operators</h3>
<p>I have to be honest I’m pretty bad at most forms of math. I haven’t touched a math textbook since I was like 14. There just hasn’t been a huge need for it. Interview challenges can often (but not usually) contain an element of math that simply goes over my head. Instead of being able to focus on the problem I end up distracted by the math. I need to fix that.</p>
<p>I will start with <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code/">math as code</a> and port it to variety of languages. From there I will dive into some more discrete math and then I have no idea. But I think “math as code” alone should iron out most of my issues.</p>
<h3>2. Syntax and Language Features</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, how many of us know our programming languages inside and out? I’m going to make an effort to learn one language completely. I will master all its hidden gems and rely on it as my language of choice for interview challenges. Part of me wants to choose Haskell but I think I will focus on either Ruby or Python; both languages are simplistic and expressive enough that an interviewer is likely to get the gist of it even if they don’t know it.</p>
<h3>3. Data Structures</h3>
<p>In day to day programming you pretty much just push strings around inside of arrays. I’m ridiculously good at pushing strings around. I can use associative arrays with the best of them. I can map, reduce and filter in my sleep. Most other tasks are googled when they come up. Because it does not matter if it takes me an extra 30 seconds to reverse an array or an extra five minutes to implement a linked list because I just don’t do it often enough.</p>
<p>It is time to justify the time. I’m going to learn basic structures inside and out and all the means to operate on them. I will heavily rely on high level languages with raw implementations (i.e not in C) of their standard library. For Ruby there is Rubinus, for a LISP there is Clojure, and for JS I shall finally read the source of libraries like lodash. Eventually I will fully grasp the techniques for working with all the data structures!</p>
<h3>4. Algorithms</h3>
<p>If data structures are an analogy and algorithms are an analogy then they are probably like heart and soul or something. Who knows. What one does know is that they are extremely important in interview questions. You can probably understand bubble-sort after watching a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4">dancing video</a> but good luck trying to understand it on the spot and fast enough to not blow away all your time with the sand. Sure, you can brute force things, but more often than not, familiarity with algorithms is how you hit upon brute force solutions quickly. They have to be intuitive, it has to be like riding a bike. Right now most of my knowledge of algorithms is like my knowledge of riding a backwards bike, I lack a huge amount of understanding.</p>
<p>I will start with the most friendly book (so described I guess because of its friendly pictographs on the cover) on algorithms ever written, <a href="http://www.algorist.com/">The Algorithm Design Manual</a> a book I have heard of way too many times but never started. From there, I will tackle the world of coding challenges; HackerRank, Cracking The Coding Interview, Project Euler and more.</p>
<p>It is time to stop being terrible!</p>

In hindsight, trying to use work as an escape hatch was one of my worst decisions. If it had worked out I would have done very well, but most things fail. Always assume you will fail and operate from that point. Ask “what will my life be like if this doesn’t work out?” and operate from that. Not going to college is a risk the mentally ill and poverty stricken should not take. I assumed success and created a situation where failure was absolutely disastrous.
