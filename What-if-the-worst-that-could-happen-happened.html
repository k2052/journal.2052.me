Word problems took math, which was fun, and turned it into a hellscape of word play and misdirection. Instead of data and variables, I had to play a game of decipher and find the data. I hated world problems and it took me years to get comfortable with them.</p>\n<p>You know the ones I’m talking about. They sound like this (you can skip the next 500 words)</p>\n<p>Claire gets to the airport at 5:45am, going to visit her boyfriend Chad in up state New York. At 5:30am Claire’s best friend Drew sees the note she left in January but he never got because his comic relief roommate Cheese knocked over the table while playing a game of hockey in the kitchen; which meant this particular letter had slid beneath the far right cupboard. Claire thought Drew had ignored her letter. Claire thought the feelings weren’t mutual. Now Claire is leaving and Drew is passed out on the kitchen floor from last night’s <em>try to forget Claire drunken escapades</em> – when he sees the letter beneath the cupboard. He reads the letter and begins crying. It is now 5:45am and Drew is trying to find his pants and keys, but what he cant remember is that last night he left his keys with a golden retriever.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, while eating, Drew will remember that last night he played fetch with a golden retriever outside a french restaurant at 3am. This is something you should not do, especially when your keychain has a small bouncy ball and the golden retriever is a professional ball thief.</p>\n<p>It is now 6am and the living room looks like the aftermath of either a Pillowstown vs Blanketsburg war or a spontaneous couch explosion. Drew has given up on finding his keys and is trying to use the Uber app with one hand while eating a 2 day old muffin with the other. He drops the muffin, leaves it on the floor and rushes out the door. Cheese will pick up this muffin for breakfast later. Claire isn’t answering texts. 6:30am and the Uber leaves with a Drew that forgot to put on deadorant. Still no reply. Drew remembers the 400 drunk texts he sent ranting about Chad and realizes that is probably it.</p>\n<p>3am last night…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>omg you won’t believe this golden outside La Food! he is playing fetch with my keys!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>La Food, the same restaurant where she realized she loved him back in October. The same restaurant where she wrote him the note he ignored. It is 3am and Claire mutes Drew.</p>\n<p>It is 7am and Drew is stuck in traffic in the passenger side of a Prius with an Uber driver that keeps talking about his education startup.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry Drew will make it. This is post 9/11 and Claire wont board for another 2 hours. One hour waiting in line next to some backpackers that haven’t showered in 8 weeks and begin every sentence with &quot;dude&quot;, 30 minutes of being groped by creepy TSA agents, 15 minutes paying for a $57 dollar sandwich, on her flight by 8:30. Don’t you just love Dulles.</p>\n<p>7:45am, the Uber arrives at the airport. A very smelly Drew has travelled 30 miles. For the first part of the trip, the average speed was 45mph. Then the sportsball team lost and the rest of trip was at an average speed of 5mph.</p>\n<p>For how long did the Uber drive at each speed?</p>\n<p>The problem with word problems is they are full of data you don’t need. Unintentionally or intentionally written in a way that obscures what they are. If you were just given the distance, rate, and time it would be easy to solve. You learn to rewrite them, to pick them apart and quickly get what you need.</p>\n<p>Interview puzzles are like word problems. Once you understand them they tend to be rather straightforward. The only reason they are hard is because the skills needed to pick apart an interview challenge are not the same ones you use to pick apart and breakdown a real world problem.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a typical challenge from Codility <a href=\"https://codility.com/programmers/task/frog_river_one\">Frog river one</a> and see how it looks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is currently located at position 0, and wants to get to position X. Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.</p>\n<p>You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.</p>\n<p>The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X. You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.</p>\n<p>For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:</p>\n<p>A[0] = 1<br>\nA[1] = 3<br>\nA[2] = 1<br>\nA[3] = 4<br>\nA[4] = 2<br>\nA[5] = 3<br>\nA[6] = 5<br>\nA[7] = 4<br>\nIn second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.</p>\n<p>Write a function:</p>\n<p>def solution(x, a)</p>\n<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.</p>\n<p>If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return −1.</p>\n<p>For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:</p>\n<p>A[0] = 1<br>\nA[1] = 3<br>\nA[2] = 1<br>\nA[3] = 4<br>\nA[4] = 2<br>\nA[5] = 3<br>\nA[6] = 5<br>\nA[7] = 4<br>\nthe function should return 6, as explained above.</p>\n<p>Assume that:</p>\n<p>N and X are integers within the range [1…100,000];<br>\neach element of array A is an integer within the range [1…X].</p>\n<p>Complexity:</p>\n<p>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);<br>\nexpected worst-case space complexity is O(X), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).</p>\n<p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1. Don’t Solve it. Describe the problem</h2>\n<p>Let’s describe this problem in a way that is clearer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have an unordered stack of numbers to go through. You can only cross the river when you have counted numbers in a sequence up to a specified number. To cross you must know where you stopped counting.</p>\n<p>For example, if you had the following numbers [1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4] and you were counting to five, then six (your stack of numbers is zero indexed) would be the answer to cross the river.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When described this way the solution should come to you instantly. But don’t solve it just yet.</p>\n<h2>2. Don’t Solve It. Do it manually</h2>\n<p>Now that you have described the problem, you can write out a manual solution. Often but not always, this manual solution is already available to you in the problems description, you just need to rip it out. For example, our Frog Jump River problem is simply:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">x = 5\na = [1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Look through numbers <code>a</code> until every number up to and including 5 <code>x</code> has appeared; when this happens, record where the number was and use that to cross the river.</p>\n<p>This is a very simple example. The more complex the case the more important this manual step will be. This step does two things;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It makes sure your math is right. In this case it is just a simple equal sign but it can be a lot more complicated.</li>\n<li>It helps reveal the data structures you will need. In our case we don’t generate any new state</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>3. Solve… Kidding Don’t Solve it yet either. Figure out the data structures</h2>\n<p>First let’s work out the inputs. The data types of the inputs were given to us in the problem definition. We receive an int denoting the number we have to look for and an array of numbers to look through:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elm\">x : int\na : array\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to work the structures for any state we accumulate. We need to hold a list of all the numbers we have seen. We can hold them in a set:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elm\">seen : Set\n</code></pre>\n<p>And finally our output; the number we use to cross:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elm\">position : int\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n<p>The solution should be obvious by now. We can write it in seconds:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">require 'set'\ndef solution(x, a)\n  seen = Set.new\n  a.each_with_index do |value, index|\n    seen &lt;&lt; value\n    if seen.length == x\n      return index\n    end\n  end\n\n  return -1\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codility.com/demo/results/training3QJ39T-N2M/\">https://codility.com/demo/results/training3QJ39T-N2M/</a></p>\n<p>tl/dr</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describe the problem</li>\n<li>Do it manually</li>\n<li>Figure out the data structures</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the approach I’m using to tackle all my training for getting better at interview challenges. I have started a repo <a href=\"https://github.com/k2052/interview-challenge-walkthroughs\">interview-challenge-walkthroughs</a> where I document working through challenges in this exact way. Every challenge has a Markdown file where I describe the problem, manually solve it, work out the data structures and then finally arrive at a solution.</p>\n<p>While there are a lot of interview puzzle solution resources out there, even dedicated blogs and sites to them; they all focus on the solution itself. They rarely cover how to arrive at the solution. They miss the most important part of interview challenges, the process leading up to the solution. The solutions are easy, the hard part is the solving. I think this gap is why being terrible at interviews is so common. We focus on mastering and practicing solutions instead of solving. Change a puzzle just slightly and most will be lost. But that is a subject for <a href=\"http://journal.2052.me/Im-Terrible-at-Interviews.html\">another time</a></p>\n"},{"title":"What if the worst that could happen happened","slug":"What-if-the-worst-that-could-happen-happened","date":"January 26, 2016","filename":"2016-01-26-WhatIfTheWorstThatCouldHappenHappened.md","contents":"<p>The summer I was six years old I was terrified a lake would swallow me up, I stopped fearing death.</p>\n<p>You just made a thing. You want to tell humans about the thing. You send an email about the thing</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey dude, here is this thing I made. I was wondering what you thought of it? Could you take a look?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You regret this email immediately. Your thing is terrible, you realize this now. You start to worry that everyone will discover you are terrible. You just wasted this human’s time. Your work is terrible. You are terrible.</p>\n<p>The next day you wake up to a hundred mentions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey dude, I saw your thing! What is this shit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Haha look at this guy and his crappy work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know right. This guy is terrible. His work is terrible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone hates you and everyone has discovered you are a fraud. Everyone knows you suck.</p>\n<p>You close off twitter and go into work. Everyone is gathered around Jerry’s desk. <em>Jerry, I fucking hate that guy.</em> They are laughing at something. You get a bottle of hint water, a donut, and make your way over to see what all the fuss is about. Then you see it, your work on a 30 inch cinema, more pixels to see more of how terrible you are, more viewing angles so more humans can see that you are a fraud. They are laughing at you. Now they know you are a fraud too. You leave early that day.</p>\n<p>You get home to an email from your CEO</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey, can you jump back on Slack for a second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fired over Slack. Then your house burns down. Then during a google hangout with a bearded Swedish guy from a cool new hip startup – you forget to put on pants. He cracks a joke about how even in Sweden they put on clothes sometimes. You don’t get that job. Your cat dies. You become homeless. One day Jerry runs across you begging for change and he hands you a dollar.</p>\n<p>This is silly. This would never happen but this is how my brain works. This is what I worry about, so I do what is easiest, I avoid things.</p>\n<p>The summer I was six some kids convinced me the pipe that ran on the lakebed could suck you in. &quot;If you aren’t careful it can pull you in&quot;, they said. For weeks every time we went to the lake I was convinced I could be sucked in at any moment. I carefully avoided the pipe and always swam swiftly over top of its location. When I’d forget and end up above it, it would send me into a panic and I would swim away as fast I could.</p>\n<p>I tried convincing myself that everything was fine and that it was silly to think I could be sucked into a pipe but to a six year old a dangerously placed pipe at the bottom of a swimming area seemed reasonable. Incompetent adults surely cared so little for the safety of children that they would do such a thing without a second thought. It seemed plausible enough to me.</p>\n<p>Try as I might, I could not get rid of the fear of that pipe. I could not forgot about it. I could not push it from my mind. I became controlled by the fear that this pipe would suck me in. Swimming that summer became defined by all the rituals I would go through to help with my anxiety. I’d always make sure I knew where the pipe was. I always made sure to swim over it as fast as possible. I made sure I never drifted over it and that I always had a line of sight to an adult so I could scream for help, in case the pipe suddenly powered up or something. My anxiety took control of me and ruined my ability to enjoy swimming for weeks and weeks.</p>\n<p>Then something strange happened, I realized that it wouldn’t be so bad being sucked into a pipe. Sure, I would probably drown and die but it wouldn’t matter, I’d just be dead. Suddenly I was free from the anxiety. I realized that it no longer had any control over me. I stopped being frightened by it and I got my summer back.</p>\n<p>That summer never really stuck as a life lesson. It was just the way I defeated the lake monster, it was how I got my summer back. I stopped caring about the worst case scenario and suddenly I was free.</p>\n<p>I’m in a constant war against anxieties, they are monsters always lurking; underneath beds, in closets, on the bottom of lakes. I have setup countless defenses to keep them at bay. I have built blanket forts, I have taken pills, I have adopted self-care and excercise regiments that make me stronger. I constantly remind my brain that &quot;they aren’t real&quot;. I’m terrified that they are real. I’m terrified of the worst that could happen happening. I’m terrified of emails resulting in me being discovered as terrible. I’m terrified of a pipe on the bottom of a lake sucking me in.</p>\n<p>In July I played in the World chess Open (U1800). In the 3rd round I was outplayed by someone much stronger than me (big opens attract the underrated – I’m not the only that takes longs breaks from rated play) and this sent my emotions spiraling. When I sat down to the next game I was an anxious wreck. I was terrified of losing. I was terrified of messing up. I was determined to not mess up. I blundered horribly and lost the game while executing a winning a tactic. My anxiety killed my game.</p>\n<p>I went back to my hotel room pissed. I was so angry at myself. I was so disappointed. I regretted ever having taken up chess again. Then something happened, I realized it didn’t matter if I lost. I was 25, I was no longer a strong junior (relatively) hoping for a scholarship one day, I was a slightly above average player, I wasn’t losing anything when I lost a chess game (except maybe some prize money). It didn’t matter if I lost, it didn’t even matter if I won. The only thing that mattered is what I wanted to take from the experience. I realized I just wanted to enjoy the game. Suddenly I didn’t need to worry about the anxiety either. What did it matter if I got anxious and lost? Who cares!</p>\n<p>I proceeded to win all my next games. Most importantly, I finally enjoyed the game again. I didn’t care about winning or losing or fucking up. I just cared about making the best moves I could. I gave myself permission to feel anxious, to fail, to do whatever the hell I wanted and it freed me. Suddenly my love for chess returned. I felt like a beginner again with nothing to prove myself or anyone else. I could just play. And I played pretty well.</p>\n<p>I have spent most of my life desperately avoiding failure. I became so defined by my desire to avoid a failing business and college that I became a shut-in. I did the greatest avoidance of all, I tried to not exist.</p>\n<p>Although I left that shut-in life behind, the last few years have been defined by the same sort of avoidance. I avoid sending emails. I avoid sending job apps. I avoid interviews. I avoid success just as much as I avoid failure.</p>\n<p>The measures I have taken to prevent anxiety have become the cause of it. I’m too anxious to try another interview so I don’t get a job, which makes me broke, which makes it hard to afford things, which makes me unable to do things, which makes me stressed. I’m in a constant vicious cycle where avoiding things makes me more likely to avoid things.</p>\n<p>I cant go on like this. I have decided to end it at the source, to stop avoiding things. I will do the reverse of what I have done previously. I will organize my life around doing the things that I would otherwise avoid. I will send the emails first. I will apply to jobs first not later. I will reach out and network and be myself. I will be brave.</p>\n<p>Humans are wired for a time when the worst happening meant death or starvation. But stuff like not getting a job, losing the chess game, messing up an interview, even homelessness these aren’t things to fear like death or starvation. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad anymore.</p>\n<p>Do you know who disproportionately are the biggest entreprenuers? The wealthy. They don’t fear less, they have to less fear. They aren’t risk seekers, they have less risk. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad for them. Want to be like them? Accept your worst case scenario just as they accepted theirs. Their worst case might be a studio apartment but yours might be homelessness. You can survive homelessness. You can go for it!</p>\n<p>When you realize that you can survive the worst that could happen you become free. You suddenly have permission to just be. You can send the email. You can apply for the dream job. You can quit the job and pursue the dream. You can take risks in the chess game. You can tell the girl you like them, You can tell the boy you like them. You can travel to far away lands. You can swim across the monster at the bottom of the lake.</p>\n<p>You can do this not because you are fearless but because fear has lost its meaning. What if the worst that could happen happened? Everything would be fine. It wouldn’t stop you.</p>\n"},{"title":"I'm Terrible at Interviews","slug":"Im-Terrible-at-Interviews","date":"January 18, 2016","filename":"2016-01-18-Im-Terrible-at-Interviews.md","contents":"<p>The time I realized everyone was a lot better than I thought, I gave up <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I was doing great! I was winning! Then I wasn’t. Then I was losing. Then I was nearly crying and dragging myself up from the depth of emotions back to a draw. I was better than this guy! I could do it! I wasn’t going to lose! Then it was over. Handshake. Scoresheets signed.</p>\n<p>My first rated chess game against an adult was over.</p>\n<p>&quot;You know what opening that was right?&quot;, I said. I’m gonna educate this patzer I thought.<br>\n&quot;Yes, of course! The Vienna game – Steinitz gambit&quot;, he said.</p>\n<p>I walked away wondering how he knew so much. Must have been a fluke I thought. I got this. I’m only 12! I’m gonna be a GM by the time I’m 15 and then world champion! I was 15 by the time I realized the significance of what he said.</p>\n<h2>Being Terrible</h2>\n<p>I had my second real interview at 24 <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>. I was nervous out of my mind and spent the night (okay days) before practicing and rehearsing social skills and topics of discussion. I was massively prepared! I was going to ace whatever coding challenge they threw at me! Palindromes?! Haha! I laugh in the face of palindromes! Linked lists?! I can link a list in my sleep. FizzBuzz?! Don’t make me chuckle.</p>\n<p>There was no coding challenge.</p>\n<p>I sailed through an interview about my work and tackled their trial run with ease. Their CEO was impressed and they flew me out to SF for a week in the office. He was less impressed when he realized that in person I’m incredibly awkward and socially inept. Despite my lack of social skills and bewilderment at whiteboarding during code reviews, I was able to impress the CEO with my speed and code quality. I thought I had this job for sure!</p>\n<p>Then came the disappointing email.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are sorry but at this time we cant extend you a full time offer. But we could off you some further contract work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I fired back:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks man, but I’m going to pursue full time opportunities</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn’t want to waste my time on further contract work. I was an awesome coder! I would have a job in no time!</p>\n<p>My third interview.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could you explain Angular controllers to us?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>umm… Yeah I guess… umm… umm… ummm… ummm</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the disappointing (but not surprising) email:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have decided to pursue other candidates</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fourth interview.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have this palindrome problem we’d like you to work through</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>okay… umm… I think I need to reverse the string first? no sure about the performance of this though…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is fine if you brute force first</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ummm… how are are we for time? um… sorry I’m bombing. what did you say again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the disappointing email:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We feel you are not right for us at this time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fifth interview.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We want you to whiteboard for us</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Umm I cant do that</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have decided that you aren’t a good fit right now. Send in your app again maybe when you have brushed up on your whiteboarding skills</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And on and on it went like that until I gave up. I was disgusted with myself, disappointed, and depressed. How was I so bad at coding challenges? How was I so bad at interviews? How was it every one thought I was great at coding until they interviewed me? Why did I keep bombing so bad? I know I’m decent at coding. It must be the pressure. I’m terrible under pressure. I just suck at interviews.</p>\n<h2>Get Smarter Every day</h2>\n<p>One of my favorite YouTube channels is &quot;Smarter Every day&quot;. In one experiment, they took a bike and reversed its steering, so that when you turned it to the left it went to the right and when you turned it to the right well, you get it.</p>\n<div class=\"videoWrapper\">\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFzDaBzBlL0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>The challenge was to ride it. It seems simple. The knowledge to ride the bike takes mere seconds to grasp – it is just like a normal bike but opposite. A funny thing happens though, you cant ride it; no matter how hard anyone tried they could not ride it. It takes Dustin (the creator of the channel) months to learn to ride it.</p>\n<p>I think the most important take away from this is not that people cant ride a backwards bike; it is that <em>we think we can ride a backwards bike</em>. This fact reveals a whole class of invisible problems on the road to mastery of anything.</p>\n<p>Knowledge != understanding, but because knowledge is how we articulate understanding we often confuse the two. When we are asked “how did you do that?” our response is to express the knowledge we have. We cant convey the understanding we have. This makes it very easy to fall into the trap that once you acquire the same knowledge that you have the same understanding. It is really easy to think you can ride a backwards bike.</p>\n<h2>The time I realized everyone was a lot better than I thought</h2>\n<p>Many tournaments after that first one…</p>\n<p>I was winning! Then I wasn’t. Then I lost. This shouldn’t have happened! I was way better than this guy! I had spent so much time studying. I had become so good! So knowledgeable! But I lost.</p>\n<p>That tournament was a disaster. I messed up so much and finished far below where I thought I would.</p>\n<p>I thought, maybe I shouldn’t have drank the mountain dew. I shouldn’t have ate so many cookies. I should have followed my thinking process. I should have asked the TD to dim the lights. It must have been the lights.</p>\n<p>When I sat down to analyze the game, I discovered something strange. This guy knew just as much as I did. He was familiar with the opening. His middlegame understanding was great. His planning was superior. His knowledge was just as good mine if not better.</p>\n<p>It would have been easy to explain this away, to think he was underrated and that I was still as strong as I thought. But I had a revelation that day. I thought to myself, what if ratings are accurate? What if this guy really knew a lot more than me and what if I really wasn’t as strong as I thought? But if knowledge didn’t make people stronger what did?</p>\n<p>I started to look more objectively at my games. I started to realize that my opponents very rarely beat me because of superior knowledge, they almost always beat me because they were more accurate, their technique was better, or they simply made one less mistake. I realized that I lost because of less understanding. There was a huge gap between how much I knew and my ability to put that knowledge into practice.</p>\n<p>I begin to realize that technique wasn’t just a small part of chess, that it was actually the heart of it. Knowledge was easy, but actually really truly knowing something took a lot more time. I had spent years of my chess career focused on all the wrong things. I had devoured book after after book, spent hours upon hours reading but still found myself ranking below juniors that seemed to work way less hard than I did.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of knowledge but little understanding and it was impossible to put any of that knowledge into practice because my lack of understanding would cause me to slip up. It was no use knowing at a high level when my lack of understanding would make it impossible to use that knowledge. It took the revelation that lots of people had a high level of knowledge to realize what I was missing was understanding. I knew a lot of chess but I didn’t <em>understand</em> nearly as much.</p>\n<h2>Why you suck</h2>\n<p>How quickly could you solve FizzBuzz without having ever seen it? Most of us like to think we could solve it instantly and most of us can. But if you had never seen it before could you really solve it in just a couple minutes?</p>\n<p>It took a few interview failures for me to decide to practice. I started with very simple challenges. What I discovered shocked me, they took me a lot of time. It often took me half an hour or more to solve problems I had convinced myself I could solve in seconds. There was a huge disconnect between my knowledge and my understanding.</p>\n<p>I had come out of interviews convinced that there must be something externally wrong because I was convinced that my knowledge was the same as understanding. I could figure out how to solve FizzBuzz in my sleep but there is a big gap between knowing how to solve a problem and being able to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>You want to hack together a quick script. What language do you choose? I’d bet it is not the language you work with on your day job. I bet it is not even the best choice. If I was asked why I chose a language, without missing a beat I’d answer &quot;Because I know it best&quot;. You would probably answer the same.</p>\n<p>Now try to articulate why you know it better than another language. Is it because you know the syntax better? Is it because you know how to implement some pattern in it? Think about it for a moment and you will realize you probably know how to implement that pattern in many languages. And you probably know the syntax of other languages pretty well too. Then, why do you feel you know <em>x</em> language better?</p>\n<p>I know many languages but when I hack something up I always use Ruby. Why? Because I understand Ruby. It isn’t that I know Ruby any better than say ES6. It is that I have all this surrounding knowledge, all these accumulated little things, that make working with Ruby easier, more productive, and generally less frustrating. If I say choose, for example, ES6, my brain knows that there will be friction. I might be able to write the same code in ES6 but getting to the point where it runs, where it works, where all my dependencies are there and working, all this might take me a lot longer in ES6.</p>\n<p>Most of programming is invisible. Working with package managers, configuring and using editors, shortcuts, detecting stack problems and honing on the problem area, deciphering error messages, being able to detect when you are missing a semi-colon etc. These are all things that just happen, that your brain does automatically, that enable you to work faster, smarter, better.</p>\n<p>When you lack understanding you can’t make use of your knowledge because you end up spending most of your time fighting against the unexpected. You keep forgetting the bike is backwards and have to catch your balance over and over.</p>\n<p>When you learn a new stack you can see the things that were invisible. Suddenly things are frustrating again, you are hitting invisible pains everywhere; package manager explosions, cryptic error messages, libraries with unintuitive APIs, even documentation that reads differently. Learning a new stack makes you see the invisible again, for awhile, then we forget about it again.</p>\n<p>Interviews are full of invisible knowledge, little things that turn FizzBuzz like challenges from a 30 minute headache to something done in seconds. In the typical interview challenge you have to;</p>\n<h3>1. Become familiar with the live coding tool or screensharing you are going to use.</h3>\n<p>Every interviewer is different, with different preferences, so welcome to a whole new world every time. If you are lucky this is a one time thing that you master in the first couple of minutes, but 40% of the time in the middle of the interview your tool is going to freeze up or crash and you are going to have to restart Skype, the Atom plugin, some web app etc.</p>\n<h3>2. Understand how to communicate with the interviewer.</h3>\n<p>Everyone has their own communication style and you will spend the first 10-15 minutes of any interview getting used to it. If you are lucky he will be a good interviewer and communicate what he wants from you but most will not. You will have to settle in and figure out whether he is a “show me” type, a “tell me” type, or a “confused and bewildered” by everything type.</p>\n<h3>3. You have to get comfortable and get in the zone.</h3>\n<p>Once you have done the previous two things, you have to ramp up, to get in the zone and get comfortable communicating and coding with the interviewer. I’m not going to lie, I have a huge ramp up time. It takes me a lot of time to warm up and be comfortable around a person. If my initial interview is with a different person than handles my coding challenge, I get incredibly nervous. By the time I have gotten comfortable I have burned through 30 minutes of time and I’m staring to look and feel like I’m a bad coder.</p>\n<p>The previous two tasks can really interfere with getting in the zone, so protip, if you are interviewer eliminate them. Tell them ahead of time what to expect from the interview and what technology will be used. Eliminate the friction and pain point of that interview and your coder will perform optimally. Of course, better yet, hire your coders through a trial process.</p>\n<h3>4. You have to breakdown the problem.</h3>\n<p>When we encounter truly different problems, like a google type algorithm challenge we can recognize our lack of understanding. The trouble happens when we encounter stuff like FizzBuzz or &quot;find the longest palindrome&quot;. They seem obvious to us and we never bother truly mastering how to break down a problem like it.</p>\n<p>FizzBuzz can seem a lot like what we do everyday but it really isn’t. Most of my day is spent configuring dependencies, finding libraries, writing React views etc. FizzBuzz type problems are nothing like that. I know how to solve FizzBuzz but I don’t (at least not then) <em>understand</em> it. Not like I understand React or npm or redux reducers or Sinatra or Rack or Express.</p>\n<p>Interview challenges are like a backwards bike. You can think you understand them because you know them. You don’t though. They look like the same thing but they are not. The disconnect between your knowledge and your understanding creates a ton of problems.</p>\n<h3>5. You have to be familiar with the tools needed to solve the problem.</h3>\n<p>This the hardest and most invisible part of interview challenges. I thought my knowledge had this covered perfectly but I didn’t. Most of the patterns you use to solve everyday programming challenges are not the same ones you will use to solve an interviewer’s challenge. There are all these invisible little things that we use to solve interview type challenges that most of the time we just forget about.</p>\n<p>When was the last time you even reversed a string in a real project? You probably cant remember. Maybe it was days, maybe weeks, maybe months. So you google and read the docs – there goes 30 seconds and you haven’t even reversed a string yet.</p>\n<p>How do you calculate permutations again? Oh that’s right, I did that once a long time ago. time 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Wait, can I use built in libraries? I can. Phew. I sorta know how to do that but there is no way I could figure it out on my own right now. 5 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>You haven’t even started on the real heart of the problem yet and the stress is building because you look and feel like an idiot that cant program.</p>\n<p>We can use the built in libraries but we cant use eval. How do we avoid eval? Oh that is right, we use send! send is just a method on Object I think – it takes a symbol – but how do I dynamically calculate a symbol again? oh, we just take a string and to_sym it, god how did I forget that. wait, I bet send actually takes a string anyway. 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>How did this take me so long to figure out? I’m an idiot. fuck.</p>\n<p>This is how interviews go wrong. This is how you mess them up.</p>\n<h2>It is easy to think it’s easy</h2>\n<p>Last summer was tough, really tough. I had expected to sail through interviews but found myself struggling and imploding at every attempt. I kept failing. I hated myself. I doubted myself. I wondered if I was ever going to get my life under control. I worried about ever getting good enough at the “social things” to get a job and make a livable income. I was exhausted by contract work and I was exhausted by job hunting.</p>\n<p>At first I blamed it on “nerves” or stressors. I thought if I just fixed the environmental factors that the next interview would go perfect. All I needed was to be rested, or prepared, or not drink too much caffeine before and then it would go smooth. But they didn’t, they kept going wrong.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t understand it, I knew how to do things but under pressure I couldn’t. It took me several bad interviews to finally realize that I didn’t understand how to solve these type of interview challenges. I had the knowledge but not the understanding.</p>\n<p>Just like in chess, 99% of these challenges take invisible skills. They took understanding I did not have. If the interviewers had asked me build a TodoMVC in React I would have flown through it. Find the longest palindrome type stuff tripped me up because I had little of the invisible knowledge needed to solve them effectively.</p>\n<p>In an interview you cant eat up even 30 minutes on something like FizzBuzz. If you do then you now have another problem, you are running low on time. And running low on time creates more problems, it makes it harder to focus, it gives you less time to work through the rest of your problem. Now you are intentionally rushing and skipping points and trying to get to solution and wondering if the interviewer is looking for problem solving skills or a successful solution and too afraid to ask because that could eat up more time.</p>\n<p>Just like in a chess game, the micro skills add up. If you had all the little skills it would be easy but without them it is kind of actually <em>hard</em>. Every little moment of friction adds up; 30 seconds of googling there, a struggle with a method there, trying to understand the performance implications there, remembering how to reverse a string there. It all adds up and before long it spirals out of control and you have lost the chess game, you have failed the interview.</p>\n<p>Nerves are a symptom not the cause. Anyone gets nervous when their knowledge turns out to be a lack of understanding. You get stressed because you have keep falling off the backwards bike. Anyone would get frustrated and start to feel like an idiot. This seems obvious! But I cant seem to get it!</p>\n<p>The trick is to not get angry, to not blame the failures on symptoms, to recognize the lack of understanding and to correct it. You have to realize a backwards bike is actually hard to ride. Then you pick yourself up and you practice every day for five minutes. Until one day, it clicks, and you finally get it. You are riding! Suddenly the knowledge becomes understanding, and “find the longest palindrome” becomes something you just do, it becomes like just riding a bike.</p>\n<h2>How I’m going to get better</h2>\n<p>I’m making a commitment to get better. To make interview challenges more intuitive. To master the fundamentals and make “find the longest palindrome” second nature. I want to get a job. I want to stop messing up and get my life on track. I want interview challenges to feel like riding a bike.</p>\n<p>Programming is about data manipulation. Every problem is a challenge of taking one form of data (inputs) and transforming it into another form (outputs). I have broken it down into the following;</p>\n<h3>1. Math and Operators</h3>\n<p>I have to be honest I’m pretty bad at most forms of math. I haven’t touched a math textbook since I was like 14. There just hasn’t been a huge need for it. Interview challenges can often (but not usually) contain an element of math that simply goes over my head. Instead of being able to focus on the problem I end up distracted by the math. I need to fix that.</p>\n<p>I will start with <a href=\"https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code/\">math as code</a> and port it to variety of languages. From there I will dive into some more discrete math and then I have no idea. But I think “math as code” alone should iron out most of my issues.</p>\n<h3>2. Syntax and Language Features</h3>\n<p>Let’s be honest, how many of us know our programming languages inside and out? I’m going to make an effort to learn one language completely. I will master all its hidden gems and rely on it as my language of choice for interview challenges. Part of me wants to choose Haskell but I think I will focus on either Ruby or Python; both languages are simplistic and expressive enough that an interviewer is likely to get the gist of it even if they don’t know it.</p>\n<h3>3. Data Structures</h3>\n<p>In day to day programming you pretty much just push strings around inside of arrays. I’m ridiculously good at pushing strings around. I can use associative arrays with the best of them. I can map, reduce and filter in my sleep. Most other tasks are googled when they come up. Because it does not matter if it takes me an extra 30 seconds to reverse an array or an extra five minutes to implement a linked list because I just don’t do it often enough.</p>\n<p>It is time to justify the time. I’m going to learn basic structures inside and out and all the means to operate on them. I will heavily rely on high level languages with raw implementations (i.e not in C) of their standard library. For Ruby there is Rubinus, for a LISP there is Clojure, and for JS I shall finally read the source of libraries like lodash. Eventually I will fully grasp the techniques for working with all the data structures!</p>\n<h3>4. Algorithms</h3>\n<p>If data structures are an analogy and algorithms are an analogy then they are probably like heart and soul or something. Who knows. What one does know is that they are extremely important in interview questions. You can probably understand bubble-sort after watching a quick <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4\">dancing video</a> but good luck trying to understand it on the spot and fast enough to not blow away all your time with the sand. Sure, you can brute force things, but more often than not, familiarity with algorithms is how you hit upon brute force solutions quickly. They have to be intuitive, it has to be like riding a bike. Right now most of my knowledge of algorithms is like my knowledge of riding a backwards bike, I lack a huge amount of understanding.</p>\n<p>I will start with the most friendly book (so described I guess because of its friendly pictographs on the cover) on algorithms ever written, <a href=\"http://www.algorist.com/\">The Algorithm Design Manual</a> a book I have heard of way too many times but never started. From there, I will tackle the world of coding challenges; HackerRank, Cracking The Coding Interview, Project Euler and more.</p>\n<p>It is time to stop being terrible!</p>\n<p><em>P.S:</em> If you haven’t guessed, I am looking for a job.

You want to tell humans about the thing. You send an email about the thing</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey dude, here is this thing I made. I was wondering what you thought of it? Could you take a look?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You regret this email immediately. Your thing is terrible, you realize this now. You start to worry that everyone will discover you are terrible. You just wasted this human’s time. Your work is terrible. You are terrible.</p>\n<p>The next day you wake up to a hundred mentions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey dude, I saw your thing! What is this shit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Haha look at this guy and his crappy work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know right. This guy is terrible. His work is terrible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone hates you and everyone has discovered you are a fraud. Everyone knows you suck.</p>\n<p>You close off twitter and go into work. Everyone is gathered around Jerry’s desk. <em>Jerry, I fucking hate that guy.</em> They are laughing at something. You get a bottle of hint water, a donut, and make your way over to see what all the fuss is about. Then you see it, your work on a 30 inch cinema, more pixels to see more of how terrible you are, more viewing angles so more humans can see that you are a fraud. They are laughing at you. Now they know you are a fraud too. You leave early that day.</p>\n<p>You get home to an email from your CEO</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey, can you jump back on Slack for a second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fired over Slack. Then your house burns down. Then during a google hangout with a bearded Swedish guy from a cool new hip startup – you forget to put on pants. He cracks a joke about how even in Sweden they put on clothes sometimes. You don’t get that job. Your cat dies. You become homeless. One day Jerry runs across you begging for change and he hands you a dollar.</p>\n<p>This is silly. This would never happen but this is how my brain works. This is what I worry about, so I do what is easiest, I avoid things.</p>\n<p>The summer I was six some kids convinced me the pipe that ran on the lakebed could suck you in. &quot;If you aren’t careful it can pull you in&quot;, they said. For weeks every time we went to the lake I was convinced I could be sucked in at any moment. I carefully avoided the pipe and always swam swiftly over top of its location. When I’d forget and end up above it, it would send me into a panic and I would swim away as fast I could.</p>\n<p>I tried convincing myself that everything was fine and that it was silly to think I could be sucked into a pipe but to a six year old a dangerously placed pipe at the bottom of a swimming area seemed reasonable. Incompetent adults surely cared so little for the safety of children that they would do such a thing without a second thought. It seemed plausible enough to me.</p>\n<p>Try as I might, I could not get rid of the fear of that pipe. I could not forgot about it. I could not push it from my mind. I became controlled by the fear that this pipe would suck me in. Swimming that summer became defined by all the rituals I would go through to help with my anxiety. I’d always make sure I knew where the pipe was. I always made sure to swim over it as fast as possible. I made sure I never drifted over it and that I always had a line of sight to an adult so I could scream for help, in case the pipe suddenly powered up or something. My anxiety took control of me and ruined my ability to enjoy swimming for weeks and weeks.</p>\n<p>Then something strange happened, I realized that it wouldn’t be so bad being sucked into a pipe. Sure, I would probably drown and die but it wouldn’t matter, I’d just be dead. Suddenly I was free from the anxiety. I realized that it no longer had any control over me. I stopped being frightened by it and I got my summer back.</p>\n<p>That summer never really stuck as a life lesson. It was just the way I defeated the lake monster, it was how I got my summer back. I stopped caring about the worst case scenario and suddenly I was free.</p>\n<p>I’m in a constant war against anxieties, they are monsters always lurking; underneath beds, in closets, on the bottom of lakes. I have setup countless defenses to keep them at bay. I have built blanket forts, I have taken pills, I have adopted self-care and excercise regiments that make me stronger. I constantly remind my brain that &quot;they aren’t real&quot;. I’m terrified that they are real. I’m terrified of the worst that could happen happening. I’m terrified of emails resulting in me being discovered as terrible. I’m terrified of a pipe on the bottom of a lake sucking me in.</p>\n<p>In July I played in the World chess Open (U1800). In the 3rd round I was outplayed by someone much stronger than me (big opens attract the underrated – I’m not the only that takes longs breaks from rated play) and this sent my emotions spiraling. When I sat down to the next game I was an anxious wreck. I was terrified of losing. I was terrified of messing up. I was determined to not mess up. I blundered horribly and lost the game while executing a winning a tactic. My anxiety killed my game.</p>\n<p>I went back to my hotel room pissed. I was so angry at myself. I was so disappointed. I regretted ever having taken up chess again. Then something happened, I realized it didn’t matter if I lost. I was 25, I was no longer a strong junior (relatively) hoping for a scholarship one day, I was a slightly above average player, I wasn’t losing anything when I lost a chess game (except maybe some prize money). It didn’t matter if I lost, it didn’t even matter if I won. The only thing that mattered is what I wanted to take from the experience. I realized I just wanted to enjoy the game. Suddenly I didn’t need to worry about the anxiety either. What did it matter if I got anxious and lost? Who cares!</p>\n<p>I proceeded to win all my next games. Most importantly, I finally enjoyed the game again. I didn’t care about winning or losing or fucking up. I just cared about making the best moves I could. I gave myself permission to feel anxious, to fail, to do whatever the hell I wanted and it freed me. Suddenly my love for chess returned. I felt like a beginner again with nothing to prove myself or anyone else. I could just play. And I played pretty well.</p>\n<p>I have spent most of my life desperately avoiding failure. I became so defined by my desire to avoid a failing business and college that I became a shut-in. I did the greatest avoidance of all, I tried to not exist.</p>\n<p>Although I left that shut-in life behind, the last few years have been defined by the same sort of avoidance. I avoid sending emails. I avoid sending job apps. I avoid interviews. I avoid success just as much as I avoid failure.</p>\n<p>The measures I have taken to prevent anxiety have become the cause of it. I’m too anxious to try another interview so I don’t get a job, which makes me broke, which makes it hard to afford things, which makes me unable to do things, which makes me stressed. I’m in a constant vicious cycle where avoiding things makes me more likely to avoid things.</p>\n<p>I cant go on like this. I have decided to end it at the source, to stop avoiding things. I will do the reverse of what I have done previously. I will organize my life around doing the things that I would otherwise avoid. I will send the emails first. I will apply to jobs first not later. I will reach out and network and be myself. I will be brave.</p>\n<p>Humans are wired for a time when the worst happening meant death or starvation. But stuff like not getting a job, losing the chess game, messing up an interview, even homelessness these aren’t things to fear like death or starvation. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad anymore.</p>\n<p>Do you know who disproportionately are the biggest entreprenuers? The wealthy. They don’t fear less, they have to less fear. They aren’t risk seekers, they have less risk. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad for them. Want to be like them? Accept your worst case scenario just as they accepted theirs. Their worst case might be a studio apartment but yours might be homelessness. You can survive homelessness. You can go for it!</p>\n<p>When you realize that you can survive the worst that could happen you become free. You suddenly have permission to just be. You can send the email. You can apply for the dream job. You can quit the job and pursue the dream. You can take risks in the chess game. You can tell the girl you like them, You can tell the boy you like them. You can travel to far away lands. You can swim across the monster at the bottom of the lake.</p>\n<p>You can do this not because you are fearless but because fear has lost its meaning. What if the worst that could happen happened? Everything would be fine. It wouldn’t stop you.</p>\n"}};

<p>You just made a thing. You want to tell humans about the thing. You send an email about the thing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey dude, here is this thing I made. I was wondering what you thought of it? Could you take a look?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You regret this email immediately. Your thing is terrible, you realize this now. You start to worry that everyone will discover you are terrible. You just wasted this human’s time. Your work is terrible. You are terrible.</p>
<p>The next day you wake up to a hundred mentions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey dude, I saw your thing! What is this shit?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Haha look at this guy and his crappy work</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know right. This guy is terrible. His work is terrible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone hates you and everyone has discovered you are a fraud. Everyone knows you suck.</p>
<p>You close off twitter and go into work. Everyone is gathered around Jerry’s desk. <em>Jerry, I fucking hate that guy.</em> They are laughing at something. You get a bottle of hint water, a donut, and make your way over to see what all the fuss is about. Then you see it, your work on a 30 inch cinema, more pixels to see more of how terrible you are, more viewing angles so more humans can see that you are a fraud. They are laughing at you. Now they know you are a fraud too. You leave early that day.</p>
<p>You get home to an email from your CEO</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, can you jump back on Slack for a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fired over Slack. Then your house burns down. Then during a google hangout with a bearded Swedish guy from a cool new hip startup – you forget to put on pants. He cracks a joke about how even in Sweden they put on clothes sometimes. You don’t get that job. Your cat dies. You become homeless. One day Jerry runs across you begging for change and he hands you a dollar.</p>
<p>This is silly. This would never happen but this is how my brain works. This is what I worry about, so I do what is easiest, I avoid things.</p>
<p>The summer I was six some kids convinced me the pipe that ran on the lakebed could suck you in. &quot;If you aren’t careful it can pull you in&quot;, they said. For weeks every time we went to the lake I was convinced I could be sucked in at any moment. I carefully avoided the pipe and always swam swiftly over top of its location. When I’d forget and end up above it, it would send me into a panic and I would swim away as fast I could.</p>
<p>I tried convincing myself that everything was fine and that it was silly to think I could be sucked into a pipe but to a six year old a dangerously placed pipe at the bottom of a swimming area seemed reasonable. Incompetent adults surely cared so little for the safety of children that they would do such a thing without a second thought. It seemed plausible enough to me.</p>
<p>Try as I might, I could not get rid of the fear of that pipe. I could not forgot about it. I could not push it from my mind. I became controlled by the fear that this pipe would suck me in. Swimming that summer became defined by all the rituals I would go through to help with my anxiety. I’d always make sure I knew where the pipe was. I always made sure to swim over it as fast as possible. I made sure I never drifted over it and that I always had a line of sight to an adult so I could scream for help, in case the pipe suddenly powered up or something. My anxiety took control of me and ruined my ability to enjoy swimming for weeks and weeks.</p>
<p>Then something strange happened, I realized that it wouldn’t be so bad being sucked into a pipe. Sure, I would probably drown and die but it wouldn’t matter, I’d just be dead. Suddenly I was free from the anxiety. I realized that it no longer had any control over me. I stopped being frightened by it and I got my summer back.</p>
<p>That summer never really stuck as a life lesson. It was just the way I defeated the lake monster, it was how I got my summer back. I stopped caring about the worst case scenario and suddenly I was free.</p>
<p>I’m in a constant war against anxieties, they are monsters always lurking; underneath beds, in closets, on the bottom of lakes. I have setup countless defenses to keep them at bay. I have built blanket forts, I have taken pills, I have adopted self-care and excercise regiments that make me stronger. I constantly remind my brain that &quot;they aren’t real&quot;. I’m terrified that they are real. I’m terrified of the worst that could happen happening. I’m terrified of emails resulting in me being discovered as terrible. I’m terrified of a pipe on the bottom of a lake sucking me in.</p>
<p>In July I played in the World chess Open (U1800). In the 3rd round I was outplayed by someone much stronger than me (big opens attract the underrated – I’m not the only that takes longs breaks from rated play) and this sent my emotions spiraling. When I sat down to the next game I was an anxious wreck. I was terrified of losing. I was terrified of messing up. I was determined to not mess up. I blundered horribly and lost the game while executing a winning a tactic. My anxiety killed my game.</p>
<p>I went back to my hotel room pissed. I was so angry at myself. I was so disappointed. I regretted ever having taken up chess again. Then something happened, I realized it didn’t matter if I lost. I was 25, I was no longer a strong junior (relatively) hoping for a scholarship one day, I was a slightly above average player, I wasn’t losing anything when I lost a chess game (except maybe some prize money). It didn’t matter if I lost, it didn’t even matter if I won. The only thing that mattered is what I wanted to take from the experience. I realized I just wanted to enjoy the game. Suddenly I didn’t need to worry about the anxiety either. What did it matter if I got anxious and lost? Who cares!</p>
<p>I proceeded to win all my next games. Most importantly, I finally enjoyed the game again. I didn’t care about winning or losing or fucking up. I just cared about making the best moves I could. I gave myself permission to feel anxious, to fail, to do whatever the hell I wanted and it freed me. Suddenly my love for chess returned. I felt like a beginner again with nothing to prove myself or anyone else. I could just play. And I played pretty well.</p>
<p>I have spent most of my life desperately avoiding failure. I became so defined by my desire to avoid a failing business and college that I became a shut-in. I did the greatest avoidance of all, I tried to not exist.</p>
<p>Although I left that shut-in life behind, the last few years have been defined by the same sort of avoidance. I avoid sending emails. I avoid sending job apps. I avoid interviews. I avoid success just as much as I avoid failure.</p>
<p>The measures I have taken to prevent anxiety have become the cause of it. I’m too anxious to try another interview so I don’t get a job, which makes me broke, which makes it hard to afford things, which makes me unable to do things, which makes me stressed. I’m in a constant vicious cycle where avoiding things makes me more likely to avoid things.</p>
<p>I cant go on like this. I have decided to end it at the source, to stop avoiding things. I will do the reverse of what I have done previously. I will organize my life around doing the things that I would otherwise avoid. I will send the emails first. I will apply to jobs first not later. I will reach out and network and be myself. I will be brave.</p>
<p>Humans are wired for a time when the worst happening meant death or starvation. But stuff like not getting a job, losing the chess game, messing up an interview, even homelessness these aren’t things to fear like death or starvation. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad anymore.</p>
<p>Do you know who disproportionately are the biggest entreprenuers? The wealthy. They don’t fear less, they have to less fear. They aren’t risk seekers, they have less risk. The worst that could happen isn’t so bad for them. Want to be like them? Accept your worst case scenario just as they accepted theirs. Their worst case might be a studio apartment but yours might be homelessness. You can survive homelessness. You can go for it!</p>
<p>When you realize that you can survive the worst that could happen you become free. You suddenly have permission to just be. You can send the email. You can apply for the dream job. You can quit the job and pursue the dream. You can take risks in the chess game. You can tell the girl you like them, You can tell the boy you like them. You can travel to far away lands. You can swim across the monster at the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>You can do this not because you are fearless but because fear has lost its meaning. What if the worst that could happen happened? Everything would be fine. It wouldn’t stop you.</p>
